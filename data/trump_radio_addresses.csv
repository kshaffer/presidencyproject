Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-01-28,"In my first few days as your President, I've met with the leaders of some of our Nation's top manufacturing companies and labor unions. My message was clear: We want to make things in America, and we want to use American workers. Since my election, many companies have announced they are no longer moving jobs out of our country, but are instead keeping and creating jobs right here in America.  Every day, we are fulfilling the promise we made to the American people. Here are just a few of the executive actions that I have taken in the last few days: an order to prepare for repealing and replacing Obamacare—it's about time; the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership so that we can negotiate one-on-one deals that protect American workers—that would have been a disastrous deal for our workers; an order to begin construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines, following a renegotiation of terms, with the requirement that pipelines installed in America be built with American steel and manufactured here; a directive to expedite permits for new infrastructure and new manufacturing plants; an order to immediately begin the border wall and to crack down on sanctuary cities. They are not safe; we have to take care of that horrible situation.  This administration has hit the ground running at a record pace, everybody is talking about it. We are doing it with speed, and we are doing it with intelligence, and we will never, ever stop fighting on behalf of the American people.  God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-02-03,"Ten years ago, the Senate unanimously approved Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. I urge members of both parties to support Judge Gorsuch and, in so doing, to protect our laws and our freedoms.  This week, we also took significant action to roll back the massive regulation that is devastating our economy and crippling American companies and jobs. That's why I've issued a new Executive order to create a permanent structure of regulatory reduction. This order requires that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must—and I mean must—be eliminated. It's out of control.  The January employment report shows that the private sector added 237,000 jobs last month. A lot of that has to do with the spirit our country now has. Job growth far surpassed expectations in January, and the labor force participation also grew, so you can be encouraged about the progress of our economy. It's going to be a whole new ball game.  But there is still much work to do. That I can tell you.  Also this week, on the first day, Black History Month, I was pleased to host African American leaders at the White House. We're determined to deliver more opportunity, jobs, and safety for the African American citizens of our country. America can really never, ever rest until children of every color are fully included in the American Dream—so important. I think, probably, one of my most and maybe my most important goal. It is our mutual duty and obligation to make sure this happens.  At Dover Air Force Base, on Wednesday, I joined the family of Chief Special Warfare Operator William ""Ryan"" Owens as our fallen hero was returned home, a great man. Chief Owens gave his life for his country and for our people. Our debt to him and his family, a beautiful family, is eternal. God has truly blessed this Nation to have given us such a brave and selfless patriot as Ryan. We will never forget him. We will never ever forget those who serve, believe me.  And I will never forget that my responsibility is to keep you—the American people—safe and free. That's why, last week, I signed an Executive order to help keep terrorists out of our country. The Executive order establishes a process to develop new vetting and mechanisms to ensure those coming into America love and support our people; that they have good intentions.  On every single front, we are working to deliver for American workers and American families. You, the law-abiding citizens of this country, are my total priority. Your safety, your jobs, and your wages guide our decisions. We are here to serve you, the great and loyal citizens of the United States of America. The forgotten men and women will be never be forgotten again, because from now on, it's going to be America first. That's how I got elected, that's why you voted for me, and I will never forget it.  God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-02-10,"My administration will make sure they have the support that they need and really desperately want. We're going to take care of them. It's remarkable to see Americans across the country come together to help families rebuild their lives. That is the beauty of the American spirit. There's nothing like it. There is a great spirit all over the country, and that spirit is what we will need to rebuild America to, as I have said so often, make America great again.  On Tuesday, I was pleased to host, at the White House, the CEO of Intel, who announced that Intel will invest $7 billion in a new manufacturing facility in Arizona, creating thousands of new American jobs. That's what we want: new American jobs and good jobs.  Intel decided to move forward with this project because they know we are totally committed to lifting the regulatory and tax burdens that are hurting American innovation and companies.  In fact, we are in the process right now of working on a major tax reform that will massively reduce taxes on our workers and businesses. We want to make it much easier to do business in America, and that's what we are going to do. We are going to make it also much harder for companies to leave. They're not just going to say bye-bye and fire everybody. There will be consequences.  I want America to be the great jobs magnet of the world, but we can't do that if we don't stop the wasteful rules and excessive taxes that make it impossible for companies to compete. Every hour of every day, my administration is focused on creating jobs for our people, and I mean good jobs, more jobs, better jobs, higher paying jobs. That's our mission.  This week, I also met with sheriffs and police chiefs from across the country. I pledged to them that we would stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement, and so too will our great new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.  My administration is committed to your security, which is why we will continue to fight to take all necessary and legal action to keep terrorists—radical and dangerous extremists—from ever entering our country. We will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people. We must take firm steps today to ensure that we are safe tomorrow.  We will defend our country, protect our Constitution, and deliver real prosperity for our people.  God bless you, God bless America. Have a great week."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-02-17,"This week I signed two pieces of legislation to remove burdens on our economy, continued to keep my promises to the American people, and so much more.  I signed House Joint Resolution 38, which eliminates an anticoal regulation put forward by unelected bureaucrats. Our coal miners have been treated horribly, and we are going to turn that around, and we are going to turn it around quickly. We are going to fight for lower energy prices for all Americans as part of the deal.  That's why I also signed a resolution to eliminate a costly regulation Dodd-Frank imposed on American energy companies. By stopping this regulation, we are able to save American companies and workers millions and millions of dollars in job-killing compliance costs.  But to truly succeed as a country, we must realize the full potential of women in our economy. That is why I was thrilled to host the White House's women's business leaders roundtable—very exciting, great women. As President, I am committed to ensuring that women entrepreneurs have equal access to the capital, markets, and networks of support that they need, and I mean, really need. And it's going to happen. This is a priority for my administration. I campaigned on helping women in the workforce, and we are going to deliver on that promise, believe me.  In fact, as part of my first official meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this week, we announced the creation of the joint United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. Actually, very exciting.  The United States also reaffirmed our unbreakable bond this week with our cherished ally, Israel. It was an honor to welcome my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to the White House. I affirmed to the Prime Minister America's commitment to working with Israel and our allies and partners toward greater security and stability. The threat of terrorism—and believe me, it is a threat—must be confronted and defeated, and we will defeat it. We share with Israel a deep conviction that we must protect all innocent human life.  So as you head into the President's Day weekend, the American people should know that we are working tirelessly on your behalf. We are not here for the benefit of bureaucrats, consultants, or pundits; we are here to work for you—and only for you—the American people.  Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-02-25,"This week, I had the privilege of visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture right here in Washington, DC. It's a new, beautiful Smithsonian museum that serves as a shining example of African Americans' incredible contributions to our culture, our society, and our history. It also tells of the great struggle for freedom and equality that prevailed against the sins of slavery and the injustice of discrimination.  The work and love of the people who helped create such a masterpiece is a testament to the legacy of so many leaders it honors. I left that museum confident that together, America can overcome any challenge.  There's a great quote by Muhammad Ali in the museum. ""I shook up the world,"" he said. And that is what he did. So did leaders like Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther King, and so many others. They shook up the world for the better, because they inspired our Nation to march toward justice and freedom for all. Today, and every day, I pledge to continue that march so that every American—no matter his background, no matter her background—has the chance to climb that great ladder of success.  It was very special to accompany Dr. Ben Carson and his family for the first time seeing the Carson exhibit. I am proud that soon he will serve in my Cabinet as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. HUD has a very, very powerful meaning, far beyond housing. It is about transforming our communities, about bringing back hope. And Ben will do a fantastic job.  That's what I am committed to doing also. I want every African American child, family, and worker to have access to great schools, safe communities, and good-paying jobs. I want every disadvantaged child in America to have a choice about where they go to school—so important. I also want to honor and promote the achievements of Historically Black Colleges and Universities throughout our Nation. They do a fantastic job. They are not given the credit that they deserve, and they are going to start getting that credit.  In order to help African Americans thrive, we are working very hard to make sure every child can grow up in a safe community and have access to high-paying jobs. We've lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries, and this has hurt the African American community very badly. This week, I met with manufacturing CEOs. We're going to be working to bring back those jobs, and I mean really good-paying jobs.  I will be talking more about these issues in my Joint Session Address to Congress and to all Americans next Tuesday evening. I hope you will be watching.  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-03-03,"Our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might, projecting power and our totally unparalleled strength at sea. This beautiful new warship represents the future of naval aviation, and she will serve as a cornerstone of our national defense for decades and decades to come.  A famous aviator once wrote that, to build a truly great ship, we shouldn't begin by gathering wood, cutting boards, or distributing work, but instead by awakening within the people a ""desire for the vast and endless sea."" So true.  In the same way, we must continue to renew the American spirit in order to rebuild our country—and rebuild it we will.  On Tuesday, before a Joint Session to [of]* Congress, I laid out a version—I hope you all watched—for how to accomplish that national rebuilding. My vision includes the elimination of the defense sequester, which has imposed steep cuts on our military. We must give our sailors, soldiers, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen the tools, equipment, resources, and training they need to get the job done and get it done right, especially in these very dangerous times.  The Active Duty Army has been reduced by more than 85,000 men since 2009, and we have over 18,000 fewer Active Duty marines. Air Force, it's the smallest it's been since 1947, and their planes are, on average, nearly 30 years old, if you can believe that. Our Navy's fleet is the smallest it's been since World War I, and that's a long time ago. Frontline Navy and Marine strike fighter aircraft are more likely to be down for maintenance than to be in the sky.  We cannot afford to continue down this path. My budget will give America's Armed Forces the resources they need to achieve full and total military preparedness to meet any and all global challenges—and meet them, we will. Investing in the military means investing in peace; because the best way to prevent war, as George Washington said, is to be prepared for it.  Most importantly, an investment in the military is an investment in the incredible men and women who serve our country in uniform. They are the best of us. They are the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known, and we will support them every single step of the way.  These are truly exciting times. Amazing opportunities are unfolding before us: To strengthen our military, to reboot our economy, and to bring back our jobs. If we all work together and put our country first, then anything is possible. Let us seize this moment and make the most of this incredible opportunity for national renewal.  May God bless the men and women of our military, and may God bless the United States of America, the country we love. * White House correction."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-03-10,"We are a greater, stronger, and more just Nation today because of women like Clara Barton, Susan B. Anthony, Harriet Tubman, and so many others. We honor them, and we recommit ourselves to a better future for every woman in America today.  On my 50th day in office, I want to talk about an issue of paramount importance to families across our Nation: health care.  Seven years ago this month, Obamacare was signed into law over the profound objections of American people. Our citizens were told they'd have to pass Obamacare to find out what it was and how bad it was. Now, we know that the hundreds of pages were full of broken promises.  Americans were promised that Obamacare would bring premiums down $2,500 for a typical family. Instead, they've gone up by more than $4,000. Americans were promised that Obamacare would increase competition and provide them with more choices. Instead, the number of plans to choose from has plummeted—and I mean plummeted. This year, Americans in nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges, or, in effect, no real choice at all.  Americans were promised that if they liked their health insurance and their doctors, they could keep them. Instead, millions of Americans lost the insurance and lost the doctor that they liked and were thrust into a cold new reality of higher costs and less coverage.  Through 7 long years of botched rollouts, soaring cost, cancelled plans, and bureaucratic mandates, Americans have called out for relief. And relief is what we are determined to give them.  I want every American to know that action on Obamacare is an urgent necessity. The law is collapsing around us, and if we do not act to save Americans from this wreckage, it will take our health care system all the way down with it. If we do nothing, millions more innocent Americans will be hurt, and badly hurt. That's why we must repeal and replace Obamacare.  House Republicans have put forward a plan that gets rid of this terrible law and replaces it with reforms that empower States and consumers. You will have the choice and the freedom to make the decisions that are right for your family. The House plan follows the guidelines I laid out in my recent address to Congress: expanding choice, lowering costs, and providing health care access for all.  This plan is part of a three-pronged reform process. In concert with the plan in front of Congress, I have directed Dr. Tom Price, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, to use his authority to reduce regulations that are driving up costs of care. We are also working on reforms that lower the costs of care, like allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across State lines. You've heard me say that many, many times during the debates.  I encourage Democrats to work with us to improve the health care system for the American people. Also, we will be driving down the costs.  We will deliver relief to American workers, families, and small businesses, who right now are being crushed by Obamacare, by increasing freedom, choice, and opportunity for the American people.  Thank you very much."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-03-18,"This week, I also traveled to the Willow Run plant in Michigan. At that facility during the Second World War, the Ford Motor Company built not cars, but entire airplanes. At one point, workers there produced a complete B-24 Liberator every single hour. Hard to believe.  Today, on that site, is a new facility, where the cutting edge cars of the future will be tested. And this week, the old plant was filled once again with thousands of workers and engineers. I was there to share the good news for the American auto industry.  We announced we'll be reversing an 11th-hour executive action from the previous administration that was threatening thousands of auto jobs in Michigan and across America. And I mean threatening; it was very, very sad to see.  In fact, we are setting up a Task Force in every Federal agency to identify any unnecessary regulation that is hurting American businesses and American jobs. The first two job reports of my administration show that we've already added nearly half a million new jobs.  The days of economic surrender for the United States are over. For too long, special interests have made money shipping jobs overseas. We need a new economic model; let's call it the American Model. Under this model, we will lower the burden on American business, but in exchange, they must hire and grow America and American jobs. This will be a win-win for our companies and for our workers.  Let's buy American and hire American. Let's create jobs in America. Let's imagine new industries. And let's build a beautiful future together.  Among the workers building B-24 bombers at the Willow Run plant during World War II was one tough lady. You might have heard her: They called her Rosie the Riveter. And when Rosie's country called her, she answered the call. Rosie was famous for her toughness and her strength and for the words that were emblazoned above her famous image. It said very simply: ""We can do it.""  If Americans unite and find again within our Nation the soul of Rosie and the spirit of Jackson, I have no doubt that we can do it and do it like never before.  Thank you. Enjoy your week."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-03-25,"More than two decades ago, one scientist followed this curiosity and dramatically changed our understanding of the universe. The year was 1995. Taxpayers were spending billions and billions of dollars on NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. The astronomer in charge had a novel idea. He wanted to use the expensive telescope in a totally unconventional way.  Instead of pointing Hubble's eye at nearby stars or distant formations, Robert Williams wanted to peer into the void. He aimed the massive telescope at one of the emptiest regions of the night sky. For 10 days, during Christmas of 1995, Hubble stared into the abyss, seeking whatever light it could glean from the darkness. And it was total darkness.  Fellow astronomers didn't know if he'd see much of anything. But Williams was rewarded, and the entire world was struck by the awesome images of our satellite returned. In that tiny patch of sky, the Hubble Deep Field showed thousands of lights. Each brilliant spot represented not a single star, but an entire galaxy.  The discovery was absolutely incredible. But the unforgettable image did not satisfy our deep hunger for knowledge. It increased evermore and even more and reminded us how much we do not know about space, frankly, how much we do not know about life.  With this week's NASA reauthorization, we continue progress on Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope. It is amazing. The Webb Telescope is set to launch next year. It will gaze back through time and space to the very first stars and the earliest galaxies in the universe. We can only imagine what incredible visions it will bring.  At a time when Washington is consumed with the daily debates of our Nation, I was proud that Congress came together overwhelmingly to reaffirm our Nation's commitment to expanding the frontiers of knowledge.  NASA's greatest discoveries teach us many, many things. One lesson is the need to view old questions with fresh eyes; to have the courage to look for answers in places we have never looked before; to think in new ways because we have new information. Most of all, new discoveries remind us that, in America, anything is possible if we have the courage and wisdom to learn.  In the span of one lifetime, our Nation went from black and white pictures of the first airplanes, to beautiful images of the oldest galaxies, captured by a camera in outer space.  I am confident that if Americans can achieve these things, there is no problem we cannot solve. There is no challenge we cannot meet. There is no aim that is too high. Whatever it takes and however long it will be, we are a nation of problem solvers, and the future belongs to us. We are truly a great place to be. I love America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-03-31,"In the next few days, the Senate will be taking a very important step, one that will protect the rule of law and democratic way of life that is absolutely a birthright of all Americans. And it involves one of my most important actions as President. That was nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat of the late, great Justice Antonin Scalia.  Judge Gorsuch is incredibly qualified. He has a sterling record. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals. But Judge Gorsuch's nomination is about more than his incredible qualifications. It's about preserving our Republic.  In their great wisdom, the Founders placed legislative powers in its own separate branch of Government. Elected representatives from all across the country come together. They host hearings, they listen to the concerns of the people, and then they try to write laws that address those concerns and make life better for all Americans. It's a process that is meant to take time and energy to ensure that every new law will better serve our wonderful citizens. That's how our democratic process works.  The duty of judges, therefore, is not to rewrite the laws, but to uphold the laws and to apply the Constitution as written. That is the solemn duty of every Justice on the Supreme Court, and this is what Judge Gorsuch will do.  In recent years, we've seen more and more judges make decisions not based on the Constitution or the rule of law, but based on their preferences, their personal views, or even their political opinions. Each time a judge substitutes their own opinions for an unbiased reading of the law, they damage our democracy. They put their own will above the will of the people, and they undermine the legislative process that has always been the heartbeat of our democracy.  The Senate will soon have the chance to help preserve our democratic institutions for our children, by voting to confirm Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.  Judge Gorsuch is going to serve our people by devoting himself to our beloved Constitution. The Senate saw this firsthand in hours of Judge Gorsuch's impressive testimony. In every step of the process, what has been clear to all is that Judge Gorsuch is a man who respects the law. He defends the Constitution. And in so doing, he will protect our freedoms.  With Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, America will be a more free, fair, and just nation for all of our citizens.  Thank you, and God bless you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-04-07,"Security begins at the border. As a candidate, I pledged to take swift and decisive action to secure the border, and that is exactly what I have done. We inherited a full-fledged border crisis; it was a disaster. Yet, with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time. Last month, we saw a 64-percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border.  At the same time, we are conducting enforcement actions across the country to remove dangerous criminal aliens from our society, and they'll be gone. In just the last few days, our Nation's ICE officers have arrested 153 criminal aliens in South Texas, 84 criminal aliens in the Pacific Northwest, and 31 criminal aliens in Long Island, New York. These arrests include aliens convicted of robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, sexual assault against a child, smuggling, drug dealing, and many more.  Much work needs to be done to reverse decades of harm caused by open border policies from Washington, but with time, dedication, and effort, we will get the job done and save countless lives in the process.  Providing security for the American people also means restoring America's standing in the world. From the very start of my Presidency, I've worked to strengthen our alliances and improve our relationships all around the globe.  This week, I was honored to welcome the President of Egypt and the King of Jordan to the White House. Now, I am hosting a summit with President Xi of China at the southern White House to address the many critical issues affecting our two peoples.  In our dealings with other nations, our conversations have been candid, open, and grounded in mutual respect. I have been clear about advocating for the national interests of the United States, something so important to me and so important to our people, one of the reasons, certainly, that I got elected. And I want to ensure that the decisions we make truly serve the safety and security of our citizens.  In matters both economic and military, we understand that a strong America is in the best interests of the world. That is why it is so important that as we strengthen international partnerships, we ensure these partnerships deliver real results for Americans and the American people. Our decisions will be guided by our values and our goals, and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences.  A future of peace, safety, and prosperity—that is our guiding light and always will be. Together, we will bring about this future for the land we love and for the people who call it home. We love our country, and we love the American people. Thank you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-04-14,"Down through the centuries, the Jewish people have lived through one persecution after another, and yet they persevered and thrived and uplifted the world beyond measure. And now the State of Israel stands as a monument to their faith and endurance.  Another day of faith and celebration is also upon us. This Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Christ and the promise of eternal salvation. It is a holy day of reverence and worship; it is a sacred time that fills the spirit of our Nation with the faith of our people.  America is a Nation of believers. As families gather in houses of worship across the Nation, we are grateful for the tremendous blessings of this land, our home. We have a beautiful country, an abundant countryside, and an amazing people with a truly bright and wonderful future.  From the beginning, America has been a place that has cherished the freedom of worship. That is the promise the first settlers saw in our vast continent, and it is the promise that our bravest warriors have protected for all of our citizens in centuries since, a long time ago.  Sadly, many around the globe do not enjoy this freedom, and one of the gravest threats to religious freedom remains the threat of terror. On Palm Sunday, as Christians around the world celebrate the beginning of Holy Week, ISIS murdered at least 45 people and injured over 100 others at two Christian churches in Egypt.  We condemned this barbaric attack. We mourn for those who lost loved ones. And we pray for the strength and wisdom to achieve a better tomorrow, one where good people of all faiths—Christians and Muslims and Jewish and Hindu—can follow their hearts and worship according to their conscience.  With God's grace, life always triumphs over death, freedom overcomes oppression, and faith extinguishes fear. This is the source of our hope and our confidence in the future.  I also want to give a special message to those struggling Americans who have felt for too long the bitter taste of hardship. I want you to know, this White House is fighting for you. We are fighting for every American who has been left behind. We are fighting for the right of all citizens to enjoy safety and peace and to work and live with the dignity that all children of God are entitled to know.  As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, we will succeed.  Thank you. Have a happy Easter, a happy Passover. God bless you. And God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-04-21,"My administration has offered a new vision. The well-being of the American citizen and worker will be placed second to none, and, boy, do I mean second to none. Since day one, I have been fighting for the hard-working people of this country, and this week, we took historic action to continue delivering on that promise.  We did so in one of the many proud industrial towns of our Nation—Kenosha, Wisconsin—with the men and women of Snap-On, who make American tools for workers around the world. They were there, and they loved what they heard, and they loved what they saw.  In Wisconsin, I signed an Executive order to buy American and hire American. I took historic action to ensure that Federal projects are made with American goods and to keep American workers and companies from being cheated out of contracts by countries that break the rules and break every regulation in the book to take advantage of the United States. That's not going to happen anymore.  I also took action to reform our immigration system so that it puts the needs of American workers first. The duty of Government is to represent the citizens of the United States, and that is what we will do. Whether it's removing job-killing regulations, protecting our borders, or unleashing American energy, we are keeping our promises and delivering for the American worker.  During my visit, I talked about how America is a nation that honors work. We honor grit. We honor craftsmanship. We honor the skilled tradespeople who turn rock and steel and iron and cement into works of art and grace and beauty. There's tremendous talent there, believe me.  The wrench and ratchet are not only tools, but instruments that help build cities out of deserts and send ships across the ocean. And the tools of craftsmen and the masons are just as important as the tools of the doctor and the dentist or the CEO or even the tools of politicians—believe it or not—and their work is every bit as noble. They take pride in their jobs, and we take pride in them. No longer will the concerns of these hard-working Americans go unanswered.  By making government answer to our citizens, we are removing the limits on our future and setting free the dreams of our people. As long as we do this, optimism will continue to soar, hope will continue to spring, and this country we love will grow stronger and stronger day by day.  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-04-28,"Our country is going up, and it's going up fast. Our companies are doing better—they just announced fantastic profits—all because of what's happened in this rather short period of time. And that's just the beginning. We're putting in a massive tax cut for the middle class and for business. It's going to have an enormous effect.  The massive Keystone Pipeline, the Dakota Pipeline—tens of thousands of jobs right there. And so many other businesses. We're really proud of what we're doing.  The F-35 fighter jet program, it was way over budget. I've saved $725 million plus, just by getting involved in the negotiation. We're cutting costs, and we're going to have a truly competitive and great country again.  In just 14 weeks, my administration has brought profound change to Washington. The most fundamental change can be found in the relationship between the people and their government. For too long, politicians cared more about special interests than they did about a very successful future for all Americans. They took our taxpayers' money and sent their jobs and wealth to other countries.  Not anymore. From the first day of my administration, I have governed by a simple idea: My only allegiance is to you, our wonderful citizens. Together, we are seeing that great achievements are possible when we put American people first.  That is why I withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That day was a turning point for our Nation. It put the countries of this world on notice that the sellout of the American worker was over.  In the following weeks, I took unprecedented actions to reverse Federal overreach and unleash job creation. We have slashed burdensome regulations and imposed a policy that for each new regulation, two regulations must be erased from the books.  We've done it all while moving quickly to restore the most basic protection for all citizens, the rule of law. A truly great judge, Neil Gorsuch, now sits on the United States Supreme Court. Justice Gorsuch is deeply devoted to our Constitution. My administration is the first in modern political era to confirm a new Supreme Court Justice in the first 100 days; the last time it happened was 136 years ago in 1881.  Defending the rule of law is a priority, not just in the courts, but also on the streets and on the border. We've told the incredible police of our Nation that they have our full support as they work to bring down violent crime rates. We've taken bold action to go after criminal cartels and made it a top priority to prosecute anyone who targets law enforcement. This has been the work of my administration: fighting for the American worker, defending the rule of law, and returning the power to the American people. Since my Inauguration, economic confidence has soared, reaching higher than any time in 9 years. Optimism among manufacturers is at a record high. And small-business confidence has seen its largest increase in nearly four decades.  Perhaps the greatest change of all is the renewal of the American spirit. As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then the Sun will always shine on our very glorious republic.  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-05-05,"On Thursday, the House voted to repeal one of the worst job-killing laws of all. It's called Obamacare; perhaps you've heard of it. Everywhere we look, Obamacare is collapsing. The House bill is a plan that will save Americans from this disaster and replace it with more choices and more freedom for American families. Most importantly, it will be great health care, and your premiums will come down, and your deductibles will come down. So you'll have better health care at a lower cost. And now I'm calling on the Senate to take action. Repealing and replacing Obamacare will be a big, big win for the American people.  Last week, my economic team outlined another step in our economic renewal: a massive tax cut to bring jobs and prosperity back to the U.S.A. We pay the highest taxes anywhere in the world. No country is higher. And we're bringing them down, and I mean way down.  I am proposing, actually, the single largest tax cut in American history. Our tax relief will be focused on the middle class, including much-needed relief for low- and middle-income parents raising children.  As we provide tax relief to working families, we must also stop crippling American industry. Right now America's businesses are taxed at the single highest rate in the developed world. This is a self-inflicted economic wound that sends jobs to other countries. And believe me, before I got here, they were fleeing fast, but we've stopped it. We want to turn our country into a jobs machine, a jobs magnet, something that really works again. We want America to be the best place in the world to hire, grow, invest, and start a brandnew, beautiful business.  And that is why under our plan, we are cutting the business tax rate all the way down to 15 percent, bringing thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs to our shores. Today's high taxes on American business are a gift to the foreign countries taking our jobs, factories, and wealth, and we're not going to allow it any longer.  Along with our historic tax cut we are proposing dramatic tax simplification. American taxpayers spend billions of hours each year complying with our archaic tax laws, reducing economic productivity and job creation.  The complexity of the Tax Code also disadvantages small businesses and family-owned companies who can't afford to hire an army of lawyers, and that's what it is; it's an army of lawyers and lobbyists or accountants. Other people can do it; you can't. And it's not fair to ask you to even think about it. That is why we are cleaning up the code, streamlining deductions, and eliminating many special interest tax breaks that largely benefit only the wealthy.  Just weeks ago, millions of Americans filed their taxes on tax day; they were reminded again how much they give to Washington. We believe everyday Americans know better how to spend their own money than the Federal bureaucracy, and we want to help them keep as much of that hard-earned money as we can. Tax reform, along with regulatory relief and fair trade deals—and we're going to make them fair, but even really good again for our country and for our workers—all of this will usher in a new era of prosperity in America and bring wealth, hope, and opportunity to those communities that need it the most.  Together, we are going to fight for every last American job. And we are going to fight for great, great trade deals that are so good for our workers and so good for our families.  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-05-12,"Our economic progress is especially good news for the millions of young Americans who, at this time of the year, are putting on a cap and gown and receiving a diploma, certificate, or commission. So important, and we're so proud of them.  This weekend, I am delighted to be participating first hand in the excitement by joining the students and faculty at Liberty University to celebrate the success of their graduates. I was invited to make the commencement address at West Point, but I will be away at the G-7—and I look forward to that—and will be at West Point, Annapolis, the Air Force Academy.  Come to think about it, a few days later, I'll actually travel to New London, Connecticut, to speak to the graduating cadets of the United States Coast Guard Academy about their new roles serving our country. So we'll be with them very shortly.  To young Americans at both schools, I will be bringing a message of hope and optimism about our Nation's bright future. That is a message that I want to extend to all young Americans today, especially those who are graduating this year and entering the labor force.  We are also celebrating all of the Americans who learn the skills and trades that generations of workers have used to build, shape, and supply this Nation. The people who construct, repair, and create with their own two hands are the people who make this Nation run. And lots of those people voted for me. That's also why, in my administration, I'm so deeply committed to technical and vocational education.  I want you to know that my administration is working every single day to create new opportunities and to reverse years of stagnant growth, falling wages, and disappearing jobs. We are ending the sellout of American workers and lifting the burdens on American industry, manufacturing, and business.  We're also rolling back the job-killing regulations that make it harder for companies to grow and hire in America. At the same time, we are unleashing American energy development to create thousands of new jobs on our soil and just off our shores. On trade, we have also taken historic action to protect American industry and bring back the kinds of high-paying jobs that can support a middle class family and, in fact, most families.  As a vote of confidence in these policies, business optimism is soaring, and employment is rising. These are great signs for America's future, the future that our new graduates will play with such a critical role in shaping our world and our country. I want every young citizen, regardless of education or geography, to be able to live out their American dreams.  So to all of America's graduates, congratulations. And to all of America's youth: We are here to help create the jobs and future you deserve.  The brightest days are ahead of you. And I just look forward to seeing you at the Coast Guard Academy and at Liberty University. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-05-19,"In that spirit of unity, I will travel to lands associated with three of the world's great religions. My first stop will be Saudi Arabia, the heart of the Muslim world. There I will address a historic gathering of the leaders of more than 50 Muslim nations. I will represent the views of the American people frankly and clearly.  Many of these leaders have expressed growing concern about terrorism, the spread of radicalization, and Iran's role in funding both. Now it appears Muslim leaders are ready to take more responsibility and a much bigger role in fighting terrorism in their region. It's about time we do it, we'll do it together, but it has to be done. America cannot solve all of the world's problems, but we can—and we must—help any nation willing to join in the common cause of eradicating terrorism from the face of the earth.  Next, I'll travel to the ancient city of Jerusalem to talk with my good friend, Prime Minister Netanyahu, about bringing peace and prosperity to both our nations. Israel is an important American ally, but in recent years, we haven't always treated them that way. It's time to renew our friendship.  While I'm there, I'll also meet with President Abbas of the Palestinian Authority in Bethlehem to discuss ways to advance peace between Israel and the Palestinians.  From there, I'll head to the Vatican, where I will have the great honor of an audience with Pope Francis. I look forward to speaking with the Pope about how Christian teachings can help put the world on a path to justice, freedom, and peace.  I will also meet with friends and allies in Europe at a gathering of NATO in Brussels and at the G-7 summit in Italy. Finally, I will close my trip by saying thank you to some of the courageous men and women of the United State military serving their nation overseas.  In my Inaugural Address, I pledged to strengthen America's oldest friendships, to seek new partners in pursuit of peace, and above all, to always put American people first.  I also pledged that our partners must show that they're partners, they must show that they're friends, and they must contribute financially to the tremendous cost. The money that we're spending is so big, it's so much, and it's not fair for our Nation. They have to help, and I'm sure they will. The fact is, I'm excited about new possibilities for peace and prosperity, and I hope you are too.  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-05-26,"Yet for decades, Washington has refused to make the tough choices. As a result, the American Dream has slipped from the grasp of more and more of our people.  This has to change. We need a Government that spends on the right things—the safety, security, and well-being of our people—and stops the waste and abuse of taxpayer funds, whether in America or in global projects overseas, of which, perhaps, there are too many.  My administration is laying a new foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American greatness. The budget we are proposing will reverse economic stagnation and open the path to millions of new jobs for American workers.  We will balance the budget without making cuts in Social Security and Medicare. We will achieve our goals by doing exactly what you do in your home: setting priorities, cutting the fat, and growing new opportunities. And the big thing for me is economic growth, which is not possible without safety and security. We will grow our economy; it is growing already. It will grow faster than you've seen it in decades.  That is why our budget reverses years of cuts to our military that have made us less safe in a more dangerous world. We are going to make sure the men and women on the frontlines of freedom have the tools they need to keep us safe and totally secure.  At home, we are going to give our ICE officers—who have done an incredible job—and our Border Patrol agents—who are amazing people—everything they need to end the lawlessness once and for all. It is our moral duty to keep our citizens safe and free and to protect the right of every American to pursue their dreams. We don't want MS-13 roving our streets; we're getting rid of them by the thousands. They're going to be out of here.  But I'm proud to tell you that the first budget we are releasing provides a firm new foundation for the safety and also for jobs and prosperity for all Americans in the years to come.  Thank you very much. You're going to love the end result."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-06-02,"In Saudi Arabia, I was honored to participate in a historic summit with the leaders of more than 50 Muslim and Arab nations, where King Salman and many other leaders expressed their desire to take on a greater role in defeating terrorists who murder innocents of all faiths. At this unprecedented summit, we opened a new center to combat extremist ideology, launched a task force to block funding for terrorists, and agreed to a massive economic development deal that will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the United States. I also discussed the importance of the nations of the region taking more responsibility on migration so that more young people are part of creating a better future in their home societies.  From Saudi Arabia, I traveled to Jerusalem, where I reaffirmed the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel. There, I prayed at the Western Wall, visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and was awed by the majesty of that sacred land and the perseverance of the Jewish people. I also traveled to Bethlehem, another ancient city of wonder, where I met with Palestinian leader, President Abbas. Both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu assured me they are ready to reach for peace.  From Israel, I traveled to Italy, where Melania and I were greatly honored to visit the Vatican and meet Pope Francis. He was really wonderful, a great guy.  Then, I traveled to two summits with our key allies: first, the NATO summit in Brussels, where nations agreed they must do more to meet their financial obligations and pay their fair share, because right now, it is not fair to the United States. But it soon will be.  Next, I attended the G-7 summit in Italy, where we worked to improve coordination on shared security threats, achieve more fair trade that gives workers a level playing field, and agreed on the goal that refugees should be resettled as close to their home countries as possible so they can be part of the future rebuilding.  Before we returned home, I was delighted to conclude my trip by visiting American military families: unbelievable people, the true source of our strength. We will always protect those who protect us.  Our first foreign trip was full of historic and unprecedented achievements. Joined by many old and new friends, we have paved the way for the new era of cooperation, one that calls upon each nation to take more responsibility to bring peace to their people, one that works together to defeat the scourge of terrorism and deliver hope to all of God's children, and one that protects American interests so we remain a strong and prosperous Nation—strong and prosperous, like never before—and a beacon of freedom and opportunity for many years to come. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-06-16,"Steve is beloved across Washington. He embodies everything public service is about; he's dedicated to his constituents, devoted to his values, and deeply committed to his country. I visited Steve, his wife, and his family in the hospital as he continues to fight for his recovery. Four hundred and thirty-five Members of Congress and 300 million Americans are pulling for him, praying for him, and pledging to him our full and total support. We continue to hold all of those wounded and fighting for recovery in our hearts and prayers, including Matt Mika, who was also badly wounded.  In that terrible crime, we also witnessed the incredible heroism of Capitol Police. Special Agent Crystal Griner—who I also had the honor of meeting during my visit to the Hospital—raced into gunfire, along with Special Agent David Bailey. They saved the lives of our Members of Congress and prevented that dark day from becoming a tragedy beyond imagination. They, like so many other courageous police officers, represent the very best of us. We salute them, and we also salute members of Alexandria Police, Fire, and Rescue.  Though we have our differences, what unites us is so much stronger: our love of country, our devotion to its people. Now more than ever, these values must guide us and bring us closer together. Let us always remember that our job is to serve and represent the whole American people and that we are all children of the same God.  This week, my administration continues our focus on providing economic opportunity for all. On Thursday, I signed an Executive order to launch a groundbreaking new Apprenticeship Initiative that will help young Americans learn the skills they need to find a rewarding career, earn a great living, and support themselves and their families.  We are celebrating the dignity of work and the greatness of the American worker. American citizens have worked every job, every occupation, no matter what it might be, no matter how grueling, how challenging, or even how dangerous. They wash the windows on our tallest skyscrapers; they create works of art from burning fire and molten steel; they mine the earth and dive the ocean depths to bring energy into our cities and towns; they care for the sick, the elderly, and the wounded; and they lay the bricks, mortar, rebar, and concrete that give us places to live, to work, and to thrive.  Today this is the message I want every young American to hear: There is dignity in every honest job, and there is nobility in every honest worker. Our Apprenticeship Initiative will make it dramatically easier for employers, industry groups, and unions to create exciting new apprenticeship programs that place students into high-paying careers. Instead of being wracked with crushing student debt, those who participate will earn while they learn. Think of that: earn while they learn.  Under our plan, young Americans will have a pathway to exciting and fulfilling careers. They will become brilliant technicians who revitalize American manufacturing. They will become welders who forge from fire amazing works of iron and steel and art. And they will become entrepreneurs who revolutionize entire industries. And these striving American citizens, including millions of talented young American women with tremendous potential, will become the programmers who change the world with the next great technological advance.  Every American deserves a path to a great job that they truly love. That begins with the right education, one that gives students the foundation for a lifetime of success. Every day, as your President, I will be committed to this goal.  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-06-23,"In Wisconsin, I recently met a proud Veteran and his wife, Michael and Tammy Kushman. When they were forced onto Obamacare and the exchange in 2015, they thought they would be able to keep their doctor, but they couldn't. They thought they would be able to keep their plan, but they weren't allowed. They were told their premiums would go down, but instead, they soared by 120 percent upward. It was one Obamacare lie after another. Today, the Kushmans spend $1,400 dollars a month on health insurance, nearly one-fourth of their entire net monthly income.  On the same visit, I met another family, Robert and Sarah Stoll. Robert is a volunteer captain for his local fire department. After their Obamacare premiums nearly doubled, they needed extra money, and Sarah had no choice but to leave retirement to pay their bills. But this new income meant, they were no longer eligible for the tax credit they had once received, and the Federal Government actually forced them to repay thousands and thousands of dollars.  These families and so many others are victims of a catastrophic law that is wreaking havoc on our health care system and our families. Democrats in Congress created this calamity, and now, if we don't act, millions more Americans will be hurt by Obamacare's deepening death spiral.  Americans were promised lower premiums, more choices, and better access. Instead, premiums have doubled nationwide, and insurers are still fleeing the market that Obamacare has nearly destroyed. Americans in nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges, and many markets may soon have no insurers at all. It really is a disaster.  The American people are calling out for relief, and my administration is determined to provide it. And we are working with Congress to get a bill to my desk so we can rescue Americans from this catastrophe. As families across the Nation continue to suffer under this law, I only hope that Democrats in Congress will have the political courage to help fix what we know to be a catastrophic situation—a total disaster—that they have created. To be part of the solution, instead of obstructing—always obstructing—change, blocking reform, and doubling down on Obamacare's failure.  But no matter what, my administration will never stop fighting for you and for the health care system that you deserve. We'll get it done. Even if we don't have any help from the Democrats, we'll get it done.  Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-06-30,"These beautiful American lives were stolen because our Government refused to do its job. If the Government had simply enforced our immigration laws, these Americans would still be alive today. That's why, since the day I took the oath of office, I have been restoring the enforcement of our immigration laws and the protection and defense of our borders.  These courageous Americans joined me at the White House to call on Congress to pass two bills that I campaigned on during the election. If enacted, these bills will save countless Americans lives. The first bill, Kate's Law, is named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. This law will enhance criminal penalties for those who repeatedly reenter our country illegally. The second bill, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, will block Federal grants to jurisdictions that shield dangerous criminal aliens from being turned over to Federal law enforcement.  On Thursday, I am glad to report, these two bills passed the House of Representatives. This represents a crucial step toward ensuring our public safety and national security. I want to thank Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his dedicated work on these critical bills, as well as other crucial legislation that will soon be considered as well. I also thank leadership for advancing these lifesaving measures.  I now call on the Senate to take up these bills and send them back to my desk for signature as soon as possible. We need security. We need safety in our country. And I call on all members of both parties to stand united with victims to stop these terrible and senseless crimes from ever happening in the first place.  This legislation presents a simple choice: either vote to save and protect American lives or vote to shield and comfort criminal aliens who threaten innocent lives. And they've been shielded too long.  As we head towards the Fourth of July, we remember now more than ever to cherish our freedom. The foundation of freedom is the rule of law. It forms the bedrock of our Constitution and the cornerstone of our way of life.  So this Independence Day, while we're enjoying treasured time with our friends and loved ones, let us not forget the families who have an empty seat at the table this year. And let us pledge that from now on, we will protect, defend, and save American lives.  Thank you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-07-07,"Here at the White House, we are dedicating the month of July to three of our favorite words – MADE IN AMERICA. For more than two centuries, those three beautiful words have been the world standard for quality, craftsmanship and excellence – and they still are today. As President, one of my highest priorities is to restore American Manufacturing. For decades, American jobs have been ripped out of our communities, industries and towns have been stripped bare, and the entire communities have been uprooted and left. Foreign nations got rich at America's expense – and many special interests profited from this great global theft of American wealth. Since taking the oath of office, our government has adopted a new philosophy: AMERICA FIRST – and believe me, it's about time. The era of economic surrender is over – and a new national pride is sweeping across our land. You see it, I see it, we all see it. Industry confidence has soared to the highest level ever recorded.  One of my first acts was ordering all federal agencies to enforce two simple rules: Buy American, and Hire American. We want to build with American Workers, and with American Iron, Aluminum and Steel.  We are also tearing down every possible barrier to domestic energy production to unleash the full power of our economy. The American people will finally be allowed to tap into the vast energy wealth sitting right beneath our feet or right below our shores. We have also sent a clear message to the world that we will not allow other nations to take advantage of us any longer. That's why I withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord – and believe me, it was one-sided. Not a good deal for our country. And the job-killing Trans Pacific Partnership, and that's why we are pursuing a total renegotiation of NAFTA and if we don't get it, we will terminate – that is end NAFTA forever. Every other nation on earth protects its own interests. America is finally going to do the same.  And as we continue to fight for American workers and industry, it won't be long before we see the Made in America label proudly displayed on thousands of new products all across this great land and exported all around the world.  Thank you, God bless you, God bless America. We are all doing a job, we are working very hard. It will be America First. It will be Make America Great Again. It's happening."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-07-14,"Next week, the Senate is going to vote on legislation to save Americans from the Obamacare disaster.  Obamacare has wreaked havoc on American lives, and if we don't replace it, the calamity will only get worse – and I mean, get worse by a lot. Here is just one story, representative of so many others. Carrie Couey and her husband are cattle ranchers. They have six children and the youngest is autistic.  Her family's rates under Obamacare skyrocketed, eventually costing the Coueys three times more than their previous plan. They were dropped from health insurance four times under Obamacare.  When I met with Carrie in March, she told us that her family couldn't afford the equipment they needed to do the jobs while paying these crushing health insurance premiums. Americans like Carrie and her family desperately need relief from this terrible, terrible law. The Democrat politicians who passed Obamacare made many big promises – but they turned out to be lies – absolute, total lies. They promised Obamacare would reduce premiums by $2,500 dollars.  Instead, premiums have skyrocketed by numbers that nobody can even believe – sometimes, many many thousands of dollars. They promised that if you liked your plan, you could keep your plan – instead, millions of American families saw their plans cancelled.  They promised Obamacare would offer better options for American families, but in the past two years, half the insurance companies have pulled out and left the individual market – and today, Americans in one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges, and they probably, will shortly have no insurers at all.  The Senate health care bill stops the Obamacare disaster, expands choice, and drives down costs – and I want to tell you the Republican Senators are working very hard to get something that's going to be really, really good – the opposite of the big lie which was Obamacare. The bill will reduce premiums by 30 percent or more by 2020.  It allows states the freedom to escape even more of Obamacare's rules and create innovative health care solutions for their citizens. In other words, we'll be taking something away from the federal government and getting it back to the states, who can better provide and who know better what to do. It provides generous funding for people with expensive health conditions, which will lower premiums in the individual market. The bill doubles the amount that Americans can contribute to tax-free Health Savings Accounts and allows you to use those accounts to pay your premiums. This plan provides states with the much-needed flexibility to better manage their Medicaid programs. It maintains Medicaid coverage for every single elderly American, disabled American, and American child who is currently on the program. It also expands the opportunity for people on Medicaid to purchase a private plan with federal financial assistance. And with these much needed, long-term reforms to strengthen the safety net for our neediest citizens, the Obamacare repeal and replace plan would significantly reduce the federal deficit. So it would be good for the federal government, it'll cost you less money by a lot, and it will be a much better plan. You can't do better than that. When I ran for President, I made a commitment to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare.  I am pleased to report that we are very, very close to ending this healthcare nightmare – we are so close.  The legislation working its way through Congress provides the choice and control people want, the affordability they need, and the quality they deserve in healthcare.  It's a common sense approach that restores the sacred doctor-patient relationship. And you are going to finally have great healthcare at a lower price. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-07-21,"On Monday, I signed a Presidential Proclamation declaring this to be ""Made in America Week."" We believe that our country is stronger, safer, and more prosperous when we make more of our goods and our products right here in the USA. When we purchase products Made in America, the wealth, revenue and jobs all stay in our country – to be enjoyed by our people. Since we first won our Independence, our Founders and many of our greatest leaders have promoted that we should afford a special level of protection to the products and goods manufactured within our borders. They understood that as a nation, we have common bonds with our fellow citizens and common obligations to each other. Making and buying made in America products brings us closer, and strengthens the ties that link us all together. For too long, our government's policies have punished production in America while rewarding and encouraging the movement of production overseas, which is totally ridiculous. The result has been the loss of numerous industries, the decimation of entire communities, and years of sluggish growth and flat wages. Throughout American history, our nation's best leaders have believed in the importance of protecting our domestic industry. This includes every President on Mount Rushmore. George Washington encouraged Americans to produce their own goods so that our young nation could become truly independent. Thomas Jefferson wrote that Americans should choose products made in America whenever possible – and by the way, I'm asking you to do that. Abraham Lincoln warned that abandoning the policies that protect American industry would ""produce want and ruin among our people."" Theodore Roosevelt stated in his First message to Congress that ""Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection."" James Monroe called on our nation to ""cherish and sustain our manufacturers."" James Garfield said of our nation's manufacturers: ""To them the country owes the splendor of the position it holds before the world.""  William McKinley believed that when America protects our workers and industries, we ""open up a higher and better destiny for our people."" And Calvin Coolidge stated that protecting American industry ""enables our people to live according to a better standard… and receive a better rate of compensation than any people, anytime, anywhere on earth, ever enjoyed."" We are now, under the Trump Administration, reclaiming our heritage as a manufacturing nation. We are fighting to provide a level playing field for American Workers and Industries. Other countries will cease taking advantage of us, believe me. We are going to build works of beauty and wonder – with American hands, American grit, and American iron, aluminum, and steel. No longer will we allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth. Instead, we will follow two simple but very crucial rules: We will buy American and we will hire American. Already, we have created over a million new jobs this year – and doing even better than anticipated. We are just getting started – believe me, we are just getting started. For every job that comes back to this country, and every factory that reopens, and every town that is revitalized, we aren't just restoring American wealth, we are restoring American pride. We are restoring America's future – a future where millions will be lifted from welfare to work, where children will grow up in safe and vibrant communities, and where our nation will stand stronger than ever before. And most importantly, it will be a future in which you – our citizens – always come first. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America – we are truly making it great again."
Donald J. Trump: The President's Weekly Address,2017-07-28,"This past week, we have celebrated, saluted, and honored American heroes who have devoted their lives to God, Family, and Country. Aboard USS Gerald R. Ford, we saluted those who will defend our flag on the newest and most advanced aircraft carrier in the history of our world. In Ohio, I delivered a very special award to a heroic military survivor from the Pearl Harbor attack – long ago, but he is still in great shape. At the White House, we have bestowed the Medal of Valor on the brave police officers who saved so many lives after a gunman opened fire on lawmakers during a Congressional baseball practice – they were very, very brave, and they truly did save lives. And today in New York, we thank the law enforcement officers who are going after violent criminals and MS-13 gang members and restoring safety and peace to our communities. All American heroes – whether they patrol the oceans, protect our Capitol, safeguard our streets, or serve in many other ways – share a common bond: They believe in America, they love our citizens, and they will stop at nothing to defend our safety and our freedom. That is why we honor our heroes and work hard every day to build an America that is worthy of their sacrifices. The source of America's strength is found in the spirit of our people. The heroes among us represent that American spirit: courage, love, and sacrifice. Our hearts are filled with pride and gratitude for all those who, for over two centuries, have secured our nation and protected our citizens.  Throughout our history, heroes have answered the call of duty to defend our country in its hour of need – and they're always there for us. And frankly, one of the great privileges and joys of serving as President of the United States is getting to spend time with these incredible Americans. Our heroes show us who we are as a nation and a people. They remind us that every citizen is capable of greatness, and they renew the promise that America will grow stronger and greater than ever before – and that's what we're doing right now. Look at all the jobs that are coming in. Look at what's happening with the stock markets. Look at so many things, where we're just getting bigger, better, and stronger – and never, ever forget our military, where we're adding billions and billions of dollars of new planes, new ships, and new equipment for our great soldiers and military personnel. After all, heroes are Made in America, and we have to take care of our heroes. Thank you and God bless you, and God bless the United States of America."
