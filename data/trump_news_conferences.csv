Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom,2017-01-27,"The special relationship between our two countries has been one of the great forces in history for justice and for peace. And by the way, my mother was born in Scotland—Stornoway—which is serious Scotland. [Laughter]  Today the United States renews our deep bond with Britain: military, financial, cultural, and political. We have one of the great bonds. We pledge our lasting support to this most special relationship. Together, America and the United Kingdom are a beacon for prosperity and the rule of law. That is why the United States respects the sovereignty of the British people and their right of self-determination. A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.  Both America and Britain understand that governments must be responsive to everyday working people, that governments must represent their own citizens.  Madam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in commerce, business, and foreign affairs. Great days lie ahead for our two peoples and our two countries.  On behalf of our Nation, I thank you for joining us here today. It's a really great honor. Thank you very much.  Prime Minister May. Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And can I start by saying that I'm so pleased that I've been able to be here today. And thank you for inviting me so soon after your Inauguration. And may—and I'm delighted to be able to congratulate you on what was a stunning election victory.  President Trump. Thank you.  Prime Minister May. And, as you say, the invitation is an indication of the strength and importance of the special relationship that exists between our two countries, a relationship based on the bonds of history, of family, kinship, and common interests. And in a further sign of the importance of that relationship, I have today been able to convey Her Majesty the Queen's hope that President Trump and the First Lady would pay a state visit to the United Kingdom later this year. And I'm delighted that the President has accepted that invitation.  Now, today we're discussing a number of topics, and there's much on which we agree. The President has mentioned foreign policy. We are discussing how we can work even more closely together in order to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamist extremism wherever it's found.  Our two nations are already leading efforts to face up to this challenge, and we're making progress with Daesh losing territory and fighters, but we need to redouble our efforts. And today we are discussing how we can do this by deepening intelligence and security cooperation and, critically, by stepping up our efforts to counter Daesh in cyberspace. Because we know we will not eradicate this threat until we defeat the idea—the ideology that lies behind it.  Our talks will be continuing later. I'm sure we'll discuss other topics, Syria and Russia.  On defense and security cooperation, we are united in our recognition of NATO as the bulwark of our collective defense. And today we've reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to this alliance. Mr. President, I think you said—you confirmed that you're a hundred percent behind NATO. But we're also discussing the importance of NATO continuing to ensure it is as equipped to fight terrorism and cyberwarfare as it is to fight more conventional forms of war.  And I've agreed to continue my efforts to encourage my fellow European leaders to deliver on their commitments to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense so that the burden is more fairly shared. It's only by investing properly in our defense that we can ensure we're properly equipped to face our shared challenges together.  And finally, the President and I have mentioned future economic cooperation and trade. Trade between our two countries is already worth over 150 billion pounds a year. The U.S. is the single biggest source of inward investment to the U.K., and together, we've around $1 trillion invested in each other's economies. And the U.K.-U.S. defense relationship is the broadest, deepest, and most advanced of any two countries sharing military hardware and expertise. And I think the President and I are ambitious to build on this relationship in order to grow our respective economies, provide the high-skilled, high-paid jobs of the future for working people across America and across the U.K.  And so we are discussing how we can establish a trade negotiation agreement, take forward immediate high-level talks, lay the groundwork for a U.K.-U.S. trade agreement, and identify the practical steps we can take now in order to enable companies in both countries to trade and do business with one another more easily.  And I'm convinced that a trade deal between the U.S. and the U.K. is in the national interest of both countries and will cement the crucial relationship that exists between us, particularly as the U.K. leaves the European Union and reaches out to the world.  Today's talks, I think, are a significant moment for President Trump and I to build our relationship. And I look forward to continuing to work with you as we deliver on the promises of freedom and prosperity for all the people of our respective countries. Thank you.  President Trump. Thank you very much. That's very nicely stated. Steve Holland [Reuters]. Where's Steve? Steve—yes.  Russia-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you. You're going to be speaking tomorrow with the Russian President.  President Trump. Yes  Q. What message would you like to convey to him? How close are you to lifting some of the sanctions imposed on Russia over its Ukraine incursion? What would you expect in return? And Prime Minister May, do you foresee any changes in British attitudes towards sanctions on Russia?  President Trump. Well, I hear a call was set up, Steve, and we'll see what happens. As far as the sanctions, very early to be talking about that, but we look to have a great relationship with all countries, ideally. That won't necessarily happen, unfortunately, it probably won't happen with many countries, but if we can have, as we do with Prime Minister May and the relationship that we've all developed, and even in the short relationship that we've just developed just by being with each other—we're going to have lunch, and we've really had some very interesting talks and very productive talks—but if we can have a great relationship with Russia and with China and with all countries, I'm all for that. That would be a tremendous asset. No guarantees, but if we can, that would be a positive, not a negative. Okay?  Prime Minister May. We have—as far as the U.K. is concerned on sanctions for Russia in relation to their activities in the Ukraine—we have been very clear that we want to see the Minsk agreement fully implemented. We believe the sanctions should continue until we see that Minsk agreement fully implemented, and we've been continuing to argue that inside the European Union. Okay?  Laura.  Torture/President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin of Russia/Russia-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Laura Kuenssberg, BBC News. Prime Minister, you've talked about where you agree, but you have also said you would be frank where you disagree with the President. Can you tell us where in our talks you did disagree? And do you think that the President listened to what you had to say? And Mr. President——  President Trump. Absolutely. [Laughter]  Q. We'll see what she says. [Laughter] Mr. President, you've said before that torture works, you've praised Russia, you've said you want to ban some Muslims for coming—from coming to America, you've suggested there should be punishment for abortion. For many people in Britain, those sound like alarming beliefs. What do you say to our viewers at home who are worried about some of your views and worried about you becoming the leader of the free world?  President Trump. This was your choice of a question? [Laughter]  Prime Minister May. [Inaudible]—start off, yes. [Laughter]  President Trump. There goes that relationship. [Laughter]  Prime Minister May. On the issue that you raised with me, Laura, can I confirm that the President—I've been listening to the President, and the President has been listening to me. That's the point of having a conversation and a dialogue. And we have been discussing a number of topics. We'll carry on after this press conference, meeting and, kind of, discussing a number of other topics. And there will be times when we disagree and issues on which we disagree. The point of the special relationship is that we are able to have that open and frank discussion so that we are able to make that clear when it happens.  But I'm clear also that there are many issues on which the United Kingdom and the United States stand alongside one another, many issues on which we agree. And I think, as I said yesterday in my speech, that we are at a moment now when we can build an even stronger special relationship which will be in the interest not just of the U.K. and the United States, but actually in the interests of the wider world as well.  President Trump. Very good. We have a great general who has just been appointed Secretary of Defense, General James Mattis, and he has stated publicly that he does not necessarily believe in torture or waterboarding, or however you want to define it. Enhanced interrogation, I guess, would be a word that a lot of—words that a lot of people would like to use. I don't necessarily agree, but I would tell you that he will override, because I'm giving him that power. He's an expert. He's highly respected. He's the general's general—got through the Senate very, very quickly, which in this country is not easy, I will tell you. [Laughter] And so I'm going to rely on him. I happen to feel that it does work. I've been open about that for a long period of time, but I am going with our leaders. And we're going to win with or without, but I do disagree.  As far as, again, Putin and Russia, I don't say good, bad, or indifferent. I don't know the gentleman. I hope we have a fantastic relationship. That's possible, and it's also possible that we won't. We will see what happens. I will be representing the American people very, very strongly, very forcefully. And if we have a great relationship with Russia and other countries, and if we go after ISIS together, which has to be stopped—that's an evil that has to be stopped—I will consider that a good thing, not a bad thing.  How the relationship works out, I won't be able to tell you that later. I've had many times where I thought I'd get along with people, and I don't like them at all. [Laughter] And I've had some where I didn't think I was going to have much of a relationship, and it turned out to be a great relationship. So, Theresa, we never know about those things, do we? [Laughter] But I will tell you one thing, I'll be representing the American people very strongly. Thank you.  How about John Roberts, Fox.  The President's Phone Conversation With President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico/Mexico-U.S. Relations  Q. Mr. President, thank you so much. Madam Prime Minister.  President Trump. Thank you.  Q. It's my understanding, Mr. President, that you had an hour-long phone call this morning with President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico. Could we get an update on where the relationship is? Further to that, what do you say to your critics who claim that you have already soured a relationship with a very important U.S. ally? And Madam Prime Minister, if I may ask you as well, are you concerned about the state of relations between the United States and Mexico? Sir.  President Trump. Well, I think the Prime Minister, first of all, has other things that she's much more worried about than Mexico and the United States relationship. But I will say that we had a very good call. I have been very strong on Mexico. I have great respect for Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I work with the Mexican people all the time, great relationships. But as you know, Mexico—with the United States—has outnegotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. They've made us look foolish. We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in, and I'm not going to let that happen. And General Kelly is going to do a fantastic job at Homeland Security. As you know, we swore him in yesterday.  We have a really, I think, a very good relationship, the President and I, and we had a talk that lasted for about an hour this morning. And we are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship. But the United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies, and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. That won't happen with me. We're no longer going to be the country that doesn't know what it's doing. And so we are going to renegotiate our trade deals, and we are going to renegotiate other aspects of our relationship with Mexico. And in the end, I think it will be good for both countries.  But it was a very, very friendly call. I think you'll hear that from the President, and I think you'll hear that from the people of Mexico that really represent him and represent him very well. And I look forward to—over the coming months we'll be negotiating, and we'll see what happens. But I'm representing the people of the United States, and I'm going to represent them as somebody should represent them, not how they've been represented in the past, where we lose to every single country.  Prime Minister May. As the President himself has said, the relationship of the United States with Mexico is a matter for the United States and Mexico.  Tom [Tom N. Dunn, Sun].  The President's Relationship With Prime Minister May/United Kingdom Referendum Vote To Leave the European Union  Q. Mr. President, you've said you would help us with a Brexit trade deal. You said you'd stand by us with NATO, but how can the British Prime Minister believe you, because you have been known in the past to change your position on things? And also, may I ask a question to both of you? People are fascinated to know how you're going to get on with each other. You're so different: the hard-working daughter of a vicar, the brash TV extrovert. Have you found anything in common personally yet?  President Trump. Actually, I'm not as brash as you might think. [Laughter] And I can tell you that I think we're going to get along very well. You know, I've—interesting because I am a people person. I think you are also, Theresa. And I can often tell how I get along with somebody very early, and I believe we're going to have a fantastic relationship.  Brexit—and I really don't change my position very much. If you go back and you look, my position on trade has been solid for many, many years, since I was a very young person talking about how we were getting ripped off by the rest of the world. Now, I never knew I'd be in this position where we can actually do something about it. But we will be talking to your folks about Brexit. Brexit was an example of what was to come, and I happened to be in Scotland at Turnberry cutting a ribbon when Brexit happened. And we had a vast amount of press there. And I said Brexit—this was the day before, you probably remember—I said Brexit is going to happen. And I was scorned in the press for making that prediction. I was scorned. And I said I believe it's going to happen, because people want to know who's coming into their country, and they want to control their own trade and various other things. And lo and behold, the following day, it happened. And the odds weren't looking good for me when I made that statement, because as you know, everybody thought it was not going to happen.  I think Brexit's going to be a wonderful thing for your country. I think when it irons out, you're going to have your own identity, and you're going to have the people that you want in your country, and you're going to be able to make free trade deals without having somebody watching you and what you're doing. And I had a very bad experience. I have—I had something when I was in my other world. I have something in another country, and getting the approvals from Europe was very, very tough. Getting the approvals from the country was fast, easy, and efficient. Getting the approvals from the group—I call them the consortium—was very, very tough. But I thought Brexit—I think and I think it'll go down that it will end up being a fantastic thing for the United Kingdom. I think in the end it will be a tremendous asset, not a tremendous liability. Okay. Prime Minister. And just on the question you asked me, Tom. I mean, I think as the President himself has said, I think we have already struck up a good relationship. But you asked what we had in common. I think if you look at the approach that we're both taking, I think one of the things that we have in common is that we want to put the interests of ordinary working people right up there, center stage. Those people who, you know, they're working all the hours, they're doing their best for their families, and sometimes, they just feel the odds are stacked against them. And it's that interest in ensuring that what we do, that the economies—our economies and our governments actually work for ordinary working people—work for everyone in our countries. I think we both share that.  President Trump. Thank you very much.  Prime Minister May. Thank you.  President Trump. Thank you very much, everybody."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan,2017-02-10,"The bond between our two nations—and the friendship between our two peoples—runs very, very deep. This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer. We are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance.  The U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region. It is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily in the alliance to build up our defense and our defensive capabilities, which, under our mutual leadership, will become stronger and stronger, and as time goes by, ultimately, they will be impenetrable.  We face numerous challenges, and bilateral cooperation is essential. Our country is committed to being an active and fully engaged partner. We will work together to promote our shared interests, of which we have many in the region, including freedom from navigation and—of navigation and defending against the North Korean missile and nuclear threat, both of which I consider a very, very high priority.  On the economy, we will seek a trading relationship that is free, fair, and reciprocal, benefiting both of our countries. The vibrant exchange between us is a true blessing. Japan is a proud nation with a rich history and culture, and the American people have profound respect for your country and its traditions. I also want to take this opportunity, Mr. Prime Minister, to thank you and the people of Japan for hosting our Armed Forces.  Working together, our two countries have the ability to bring greater harmony, stability, and prosperity to the Pacific region and beyond, improving countless lives in the process. We are committed to that goal, highly committed.  Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the United States of America, I thank you for being with us today. We will soon be traveling to the great State of Florida, where I know we will have a long and very successful talk, negotiations, and a very, very productive weekend.  Mr. Prime Minister.  Prime Minister Abe. This is the fourth time in 6 months for me to visit the United States. The last time was in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, at the end of last year. I am indeed sincerely grateful for the always heartwarming welcome accorded to me by the American people.  I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to President Trump. Donald, you must have been very busy in this very important period of 100 days after your Inauguration. And thank you very much for inviting me over to the White House. My name is Abe, but in the United States, some people mistakenly pronounce my name as ""Abe."" But that is not bad, because even in Japan, everybody knows the name of that great President, that farmer-carpenter's son can become a President. And that fact, 150 years ago, surprised the Japanese, who were still under the shogunate rule. The Japanese opened their eyes to democracy. The United States is the champion of democracy. Donald, President, you are excellent businessman, but you have never been in the Congress or been a Governor. You have not experienced being in the public office. But you have fought the uphill struggle and fight for more than a year in the election campaign to become a new President. And this is the dynamism of democracy. I would like to celebrate and congratulate Donald being sworn in as the President.  The United States is a country having the largest number of chances, opportunities in the world. That has always been the case right now, as well as going forward. This will never change. And that is the reason why automotive industries and other Japanese businesses have built factories all over the United States, to engage in local production here. Last year, from Japan to the United States, there have been more than $150 billion of new investment being made into the United States. And those Japanese businesses have created a large number of jobs. The mutually beneficial economic relations have been built by Japan and United States. With President Trump taking on the leadership, I'm sure there will be—major-scale infrastructure investment will be made, including the fast-speed train.  Those of you who have rode on the Japanese Shinkansen, I'm sure you would appreciate the speed, the comfort and safety with the latest mag-lev technology. From Washington, DC, to New York, where Trump Tower exists, only 1 hour would it take if you ride the maglev train from Washington, DC, here to New York. Japan, with our high level of technical capability, we will be able to contribute to President Trump's growth strategy. There will be even more new jobs being born in the United States.  And to further deepen these bilateral economic relations, between Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence there will be a cross-sectoral dialogue to be held. And we have agreed on this.  And furthermore, in Asia-Pacific, where we see dramatic growth to expand free trade and investment, this will be a big chance for both Japan and the United States. But of course, it must be done in a fair manner. Never should a state-owned company, backed by state capital, should not make any economic intervention. Free ride on intellectual property should not be condoned. In Asia-Pacific region, with Japan and U.S. taking on the leadership to create free and fair market based upon rules, should be built. I and President Trump has confirmed on our strong will to do so.  The cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Asia-Pacific, that is the strong Japan-U.S. alliance. And this is an unwavering ties between our two countries. I and President Trump will work together to further strengthen our alliance. We have shared this strong resolve.  As we see increasingly difficult security environment, we have confirmed that U.S.-Japan security pact article 5 will be applied to Senkaku Islands. The United States will strengthen its presence in the region. And under the banner of the proactive contribution to peace, Japan will play a greater role. At the same time, we will maintain the deterrence and also to proceed on reducing the impact we had a will—fought through on the realignment of the U.S. Forces in Japan. And Henoko's—relocation to Henoko of the MCAS Futenma is the only solution. And Japan and U.S. will continue to work closely on this.  On North Korea, we had—would strongly demand North Korea to abandon nuclear and ballistic missile program and not to make any more provocations. And we have completely agreed on the importance of the early solution for the abduction issue. And East China Sea, South China Sea, and Indian Ocean—everywhere, we need to maintain the freedom of navigation and rule of law. And such international order there must be maintained.  Japan and United States have confirmed that we will strongly protest any use of force, as well as coercion to change the status quo. I and the President will address not only bilateral, but regional issues. And we have had a very frank exchange of views on the peace and prosperity of the world that we should contribute, for any form of terrorism should be strongly condemned. And we had—would cooperate in our fight against terrorism. Japan had—will, of course, exercise a commensurate role in this regard. And furthermore, the regional conflict, the refugees, poverty, and infectious diseases—there are many challenges faced by the world, which will be a serious issue to threaten the peace and stability for Japan as well as the United States.  But Japan and the United States and the international community must work hand in hand in order to solve these questions. Of course, there are disagreements, but we should not close down dialogue just by pointing to the differences and ignoring the common interests and common goals. We need to have a dialogue, because there are disagreements. What we mostly desire—what is most desired by those who are challenging the existing international order is to just focus on differences. We should not close the dialogue. Japan have for 4 years that—I have consistently followed through on our foreign policy.  Now, whatever the challenge and difficulty ahead of us, I and Trump—President Trump will continue our dialogue to seek shared solutions. And after lunch, I am looking forward for a weekend in Florida with Donald. We will play golf together. My scores in golf will—is not up to the level of Donald at all, but my policy is never up, never in, always aiming for the cup—never to adjust the goal with the shortcuts and short—chops. Those are the words never found in my dictionary. [Laughter]  But in a relaxed atmosphere, I hope to take time to discuss with Donald on the future of the world, future of the region, and future of Japan and United States.  Thank you.  President Trump. Thank you very much. We'll take a few questions, unless you don't want to ask any questions, if that's possible. [Laughter] Maybe we'll start—where is Daniel Halper, New York Post? Daniel.  Executive Order on Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'm curious about yesterday's ruling in the 9th Circuit Court. Has it caused you to rethink your use of executive power? And how will you respond? And will you sign new Executive orders or perhaps a new travel ban?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm curious about your reaction to America's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP. Do you think that that's weakened America's position in Asia? And how do you think—how do you envision any sort of trade deal with the President working out?  President Trump. Well, your question was unrelated to what we're here for today, but I'll answer it. We are going to keep our country safe; we are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think we'll be very successful with. It shouldn't have taken this much time, because safety is a primary reason. One of the reasons I'm standing here today is the security of our country. The voters felt that I would give it the best security. So we'll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country. You'll be seeing that sometime next week.  In addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately, I have no doubt that we'll win that particular case.  Prime Minister Abe. Now, in the world, we are also facing the issues of the refugees and terrorism. We need to work closely together on these global issues. Japan have always played our own role, but going forward, we would continue to work with the international community to execute our responsibility in a commensurate manner. And each of our country has immigration control scheme, as well as policy on immigration, as well as refugees. These are to do with domestic affairs of that country, so I would refrain from making any comments.  President Trump. Okay. Blake Berman, Fox. Blake Berman.  Terrorism  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to pick up where Daniel left off, if you don't mind. You said earlier this week—and I'm quoting for you—you said, ""I've learned a lot in the last 2 weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand, but we're going to take care of it.""  Based off of what you have learned, and now knowing that your Executive order is at least temporarily on hold, do you still feel as confident now as you have been at any point, that you and the administration will be able to protect the homeland?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. I would just like to pick off again on what Daniel had asked about TPP. Do you feel it's a mistake that the United States has at least signaled its intention to withdraw from the deal? Thank you, both.  President Trump. I feel totally confident that we will have tremendous security for the people of the United States. We will be extreme vetting, which is a term that I developed early in my campaign because I saw what was happening. And while I've been President, which is just for a very short period of time, I've learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely, President. And there are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen, I can tell you that right now. We will not allow that to happen.  So we'll be going forward. We'll be doing things to continue to make our country safe. It will happen rapidly. And we will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people. We will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people and do good for our country. It's always going to be that way, at least during my administration, I can tell you that.  Prime Minister Abe. On TPP—oh, of course, we are fully aware of President Trump's decision. On economic issues, we will be discussing at the working lunch to follow. As for Japan and United States, trade and investment, as well as economic relations, how can we develop and grow our relationship? As I have already mentioned, Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence will create a new framework for dialogue, and I am quite optimistic that the good results will be seen from the dialogue.  Now, for the free and fair common set of rules to be created for the free trade regime in the region, and that was the purpose of TPP, and that—the importance have not changed. I, myself, believe that.  Job Creation/Manufacturing Industry/Japan-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you. My name is Hara from NHK. I have a question to Prime Minister Abe. Now, for the automotive market in Japan, as well as foreign exchange of Japan, in the prior remarks there have been discrepancy in your positions. So at the summit meeting, what were the discussions? And were you able to narrow down the gap?  And President Trump had said that he will make the United States a great country. What is meant by the ""great country""? And, Prime Minister, what do you mean when you say United States is a great ally for you? Prime Minister Abe. Now with the birth of the Trump administration, a new genesis will be built between Japan and U.S. in economic relations. In order to put forward such strong message, I have proposed to launch a new framework for economic dialogue, and we were able to agree on this.  As for sectoral discussions, we will be having a discussion at our working lunch. In any case, between President Trump and I, myself, on Japan and U.S. economic relations, we will—we have already agreed that we will have Vice President Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Aso to discuss fully on the economic relations between our two countries. And we are looking forward for the good results to ensue from the debate between the experts. As for the foreign exchange, we will have—Secretary of Treasury and the Minister of Finance will continue the close communication.  For the United States to become a great nation, the various roles played by the United States and the responsibility to go with it, the world over is faced with increasing uncertainty. That United States will become a great America and become a great and strong ally would be good for Japan. And for Japan and U.S. alliance to be further strengthened would be good not only for our two nations, but also contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific. And United States to become even greater, we will welcome that.  President Trump. Thank you. I will say that—and you've seen it—ever since I won the election and became President-elect, I've been telling companies—car companies and other companies—many companies: Come back into the United States. And they've been coming back in. And big announcements are going to be made over the next short period of time. Some of you already know what those announcements are.  We've lost a lot of our factories, a lot of our plants. And those factories and those plants will be coming back. And jobs will be coming back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina and so many other places where we've lost so many jobs. And those are the people that were so good to me, and now I'm being good to them.  And so we've had a tremendous number of announcements. We've had Ford and General Motors and many, many others—Intel yesterday made a major announcement. And they did that because of what is happening with our tax structure, which is going along very well. And we'll be having some very big news over the next short period of time.  But we are a nation of tremendous potential. And the expression ""Make America Great Again,"" I will tell you—and I will add very strongly and with great assurety—it will be greater than ever before.  And I just want to thank the Prime Minister for a friendship. We developed a great friendship when we met in New York City at Trump Tower. We spoke for a long, long period of time. And when I greeted him today at the car, I was saying—I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that's the way we feel. We have a very, very good bond, very, very good chemistry. I'll let you know if it changes, but I don't think it will. [Laughter]  So I just want to thank the Prime Minister for being here. We're going to be meeting your wife in a very short period of time, and I look very much forward to that.  And I want to thank everybody in the room. We're going to have a tremendous relationship, long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan.  Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister.  Prime Minister Abe. One more.  President Trump. Yes, certainly. Okay, go ahead. China-U.S. Relations/Trade/Health Care Reform  Q. Thank you very much. From Sankei Shimbun, my name is Takita. I have a question to President Trump. Obama administration, under the rebalance to Asia, have emphasized Asia. But China is taking hardline stance in South China Sea, as well as China Sea. And North Korea has went on with the missiles and nuclear development. So some countries in Asia are concerned over commitment of United States in Asia. So, against this backdrop, as was mentioned earlier, for the Trump administration, for the situations in Asia, how would you respond to the increasing difficulty here?  And, President, you have repeatedly stated about China taking on the currency—foreign exchange policies which are not good for the United States. Do you think that eventually it will change in the future?  President Trump. I had a very, very good conversation, as most of you know, yesterday with the President of China. It was a very, very warm conversation. I think we are on the process of getting along very well. And I think that will also be very much of a benefit to Japan. So we had a very, very good talk last night and discussed a lot of subjects. It was a long talk. And we are working on that as we speak. We have conversations with various representatives of China. I believe that that will all work out very well for everybody: China, Japan, the United States, and everybody in the region.  As far as the currency devaluations, I've been complaining about that for a long time. And I believe that we will all eventually—and probably, very much sooner than a lot of people understand or think—we will be all at a level playing field, because that's the only way it's fair. That's the only way that you can fairly compete in trade and other things. And we will be on that field, and we will all be working very hard to do great for our country. But it has to be fair. And we will make it fair.  I think the United States is going to be an even bigger player than it is right now, by a lot, when it comes to trade. A lot of that will have to do with our tax policy, which you'll be seeing in the not-too-distant future. We'll have an incentive based policy much more so than we have right now. Right now we don't even know—nobody knows what policy we have. But we're going to have a very much incentive-based policy. We're working with Congress, working with Paul Ryan, working with Mitch McConnell. And I think people are going to be very, very impressed.  We're also working very much—and this has a lot to do with business—on health care, where we can get great health care for our country at a much-reduced price, both to the people receiving the health care and to our country. Because our country is paying so much, and Obamacare, as you know, is a total and complete disaster. So we're going to end up with tremendous health care at a lower price. And I think people are going to be extremely happy. Difficult process, but once we get going—and as you know, Tom Price was just approved a few hours ago. So we finally have our Secretary, and now we get down to the final strokes.  Again, I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank Mr. Prime Minister. What an honor, what a great honor it is. And let's go to Florida. [Laughter]"
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Justin P.J. Trudeau of Canada,2017-02-13,"Our two nations share much more than a border. We share the same values. We share the love—and a truly great love—of freedom. And we share a collective defense. American and Canadian troops have gone to battle together, fought wars together, and forged the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together, which we have.  In these dangerous times, it is more important than ever that we continue to strengthen our vital alliance. The United States is deeply grateful for Canada's contribution to the counter-ISIS effort. Thank you. And we continue to work in common—and in common cause—against terrorism and work in common cooperation toward reciprocal trade and shared growth.  We understand that both of our countries are stronger when we join forces in matters of international commerce. Having more jobs and trade right here in North America is better for both the United States and is also much better for Canada. We should coordinate closely—and we will coordinate closely—to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe.  Prime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests. This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada. It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration. And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.  America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada. We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce. Both of us are committed to bringing greater prosperity and opportunity to our people.  We just had a very productive meeting with women business leaders from the United States and Canada, where we discussed how to secure everything that we know the full power of women can do better than anybody else. We know that. I just want to say, Mr. Prime Minister, that I'm focused—and you're focused—on the important role women play in our economies. We must work to address the barriers faced by women and women entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and very importantly, access to networks.  In our discussion today, we will focus on improving the ways our Government and our governments together can benefit citizens of both the United States and Canada and, in so doing, advance the greater peace and stability of the world.  Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to working closely with you to build upon our very historic friendship. There are incredible possibilities for us to pursue, Canada and the United, States together. Again, thank you for joining us, and I know our discussions will be very, very productive for the future of both countries.  Mr. Prime Minister.  Prime Minister Trudeau. Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much for joining us.  I'd first like to start by extending my sincere thanks to President Trump for inviting me down to Washington. Any day I get to visit our southern neighbors is a good day in my book, particularly when it's so nice and warm compared to what it is back home. We are suffering under a significant winter storm that's hitting our Atlantic Provinces particularly harsh, so I just want to send everyone back at home my thoughts as they shovel out and impress on everyone to stay safe.  [At this point, Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  The President and myself have had a very productive first meeting today. We had the opportunity to get to know one another better, and more importantly, we had the opportunity to talk about the unique relationship between Canada and the United States.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]  [Inaudible]—friends on both sides of the 49th parallel have understood that the bond between our nations is a special one. No other neighbors in the entire world are as fundamentally linked as we are. We've fought in conflict zones together, negotiated environmental treaties together, including 1991's historic Air Quality Agreement. And we've entered into groundbreaking economic partnerships that have created good jobs for both of our peoples.  Canadians and Americans alike share a common history as well as people-to-people ties that make us completely and totally integrated. Our workers are connected by trade, transportation, and cross-border commerce. Our communities rely on each other for security, stability, and economic prosperity. Our families have long lived together and worked together. We know that, more often than not, our victories are shared. And just as we celebrate together, so too do we suffer loss and heartbreak together.  Through it all, the foundational pillar upon which our relationship is built is one of mutual respect. And that's a good thing, because as we know, relationships between neighbors are pretty complex, and we won't always agree on everything. But because of our deep, abiding respect for one another, we're able to successfully navigate those complexities and still remain the closest of allies and friends. Make no mistake: At the end of the day, Canada and the U.S. will always remain each other's most essential partner.  And today's conversations have served to reinforce how important that is for both Canadians and Americans. As we know, 35 U.S. States list Canada as their largest export market, and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day. Millions of good, middle class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership. Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we're going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead. [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  As we know, 35 U.S. States list Canada as their largest export market, and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day.

Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we're going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]  I'd like to highlight just a few of the specifics that President Trump and I discussed today. At the end of the day, the President and I share a common goal. We both want to make sure that hard-working folks can go to work at a good job, put food on the table for their families, and save up to take a vacation every once in a while. That's what we're trying to do here.  Today we reiterated that our nations are committed to collaborating on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment. And as we know, investing in infrastructure is a great way to create the kind of economic growth that our countries so desperately need.  In that same vein, we know that ensuring equal opportunities for women in the workforce is essential for growing the economy and maintaining American and Canadian competitiveness on the world stage. As such, the President and I have agreed to the creation of the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. This initiative is more than just about dollars and cents. This is about ensuring that women have access to the same opportunities as men and prioritizing the support and empowerment of women who are senior business leaders and entrepreneurs. In doing so, we'll grow the Canadian and American economies and help our businesses prosper.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Finally, President Trump and myself have agreed to work together to fight against the traffic of opioids across our border. The rise of illegal use of opioids in our society is nothing less than a tragedy. We will do everything we can to ensure the safety of Canadians and Americans.  Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump: I know that if our countries continue to work together, our people will greatly benefit from this cooperation.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]  History has demonstrated time and again that in order to tackle our most pressing issues, both foreign and domestic, we must work with our closest allies, learn from each other, and stand in solidarity as a united voice.  With a level of economic and social integration that is unmatched on the world stage, Canada and the United States will forever be a model example of how to be good neighbors. Winston Churchill once said, ""That long Canadian frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations, is an example to every country and a pattern for the future of the world."" That, my friends, is the very essence of the Canada-U.S. relationship.  I look forward to working with President Trump over the coming years to nurture and build upon this historic partnership. Once again, it's a tremendous pleasure to be here in Washington. Merci beaucoup.  President Trump. Okay, we'll take a couple of questions. Scott Thuman [WJLA, Sinclair Broadcasting Group]. Scott.  Canada-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you, Mr. President.  President Trump. Thank you.  Q. You just spoke about the desire to build bridges, although there are some notable and philosophical differences between yourself and Prime Minister Trudeau. I'm curious, as you move forward on issues from trade to terrorism, how do you see this relationship playing out? And are there any specific areas with which during your conversations today you each decided to perhaps alter or amend your stances already on those sensitive issues like terrorism and immigration?  And, Prime Minister Trudeau, while only in its infancy so far, how do you see this relationship compared to that under the Obama administration?  President Trump. Well, we just began discussions. We are going to have a great relationship with Canada, maybe as good or better, hopefully, than ever before. We have some wonderful ideas on immigration. We have some, I think, very strong, very tough ideas on the tremendous problem that we have with terrorism. And I think when we put them all together, which will be very, very quickly—we have a group of very talented people—we will see some very, very obvious results. We're also doing some cross-border things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster for trade.  We have—through technology, we have some really great ideas, and they'll be implemented fairly quickly.  Prime Minister Trudeau. One of the things we spoke about was the fact that security and immigration need to work very well together. And certainly, Canada has emphasized security as we look towards improving our immigration system and remaining true to the values that we have. And we had a very strong and fruitful discussion on exactly that.  There's plenty that we can draw on each other from in terms of how we move forward with a very similar goal, which is to create free, open societies that keep our citizens safe. And that's certainly something that we're very much in agreement on.  Tonda MacCharles [Toronto Star].  Immigration  Q. Good afternoon, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister. And, Mr. Prime Minister, could you answer in English and French for us, please?  A little bit of a follow-on on my American colleague's question. President Trump, you seem to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the Prime Minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms. So I'd like to know, are you confident the northern border is secure? President Trump. You can never be totally confident. But through the incredible efforts—already, I see it happening—of formerly General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, we have really done a great job. We're actually taking people that are criminals—very, very hardened criminals in some cases, with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems—and we're getting them out. And that's what I said I would do. I'm just doing what I said I would do when we won by a very, very large electoral college vote.  And I knew that was going to happen. I knew this is what people were wanting. And that wasn't the only reason, that wasn't my only thing that we did so well on. But that was something was very important. And I said we will get the criminals out, the drug lords, the gang members. We're getting them out.  General Kelly, who is sitting right here, is doing a fantastic job. And I said at the beginning, we are going to get the bad ones—the really bad ones, we're getting them out. And that's exactly what we're doing.  I think that in the end everyone is going to be extremely happy. And I will tell you right now, a lot of people are very, very happy right now.  Prime Minister Trudeau. Canada has always understood that keeping Canadians safe is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any government. And that's certainly something that we're very much focused on.  At the same time, we continue to pursue our policies of openness towards immigration, refugees, without compromising security. And part of the reason we're—we have been successful in doing that over the past year—welcoming close to 40,000 Syrian refugees—is because we have been coordinating with our allies, the United States and around the world, to demonstrate that security comes very seriously to us. And that's something that we continue to deal with.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  It is clear that if you want to have a healthy and secure society or safe society, you have to make sure that you maintain—that you focus on security. And we have welcomed refugees from Syria. We have been very successful, but we have always taken our responsibility toward security very seriously. And our allies, including the United States, understand this focus very well. And they have done so since the very beginning.  President Trump. Kaitlan Collins [Daily Caller], please.  U.S. National Security/North Korea/Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan/Immigration  Q. Thank you. President Trump, now that you've been in office and received intelligence briefings for nearly 1 month, what do you see as the most important national security matters facing us?  And, Prime Minister Trudeau, you've made very clear that Canada has an open-door policy for Syrian refugees. Do you believe that President Trump's moratorium on immigration has merit on national security grounds?  President Trump. Okay. Thank you. Many, many problems. When I was campaigning, I said it's not a good situation. Now that I see it—including with our intelligence briefings—we have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are, not only internationally, but when you come right here. Well, I mean, obviously, North Korea is a big, big problem, and we will deal with that very strongly. We have problems all over the Middle East. We have problems just about every corner of the globe, no matter where you look. I had a great meeting this weekend with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and got to know each other very, very well—extended weekend, really. We were with each other for long periods of time and our staffs and representatives.  But on the home front, we have to create borders. We have to let people that can love our country in, and I want to do that. We want to have a big, beautiful, open door, and we want people to come in and come in our country. But we cannot let the wrong people in, and I will not allow that to happen during this administration. And people—citizens of our country—want that, and that's their attitude too, I will tell you.  We are getting such praise for our stance, and it's a stance of common sense—maybe a certain toughness, but it's really more than toughness, it's a stance of common sense—and we are going to pursue it vigorously. And we don't want to have our country have the kinds of problems that you're witnessing taking place not only here, but all over the world. We won't stand for it. We won't put up for—with it. We're just not going to let it happen. We're going to give ourselves every bit of chance so that things go well for the United States. And they will go well. Thank you.  Prime Minister Trudeau. Canada and the United States have been neighbors a long time, and Canadians and Americans have stood together, worked together at home and around the world. We've fought and died together in battlefields in World War I and World War II, in Korea, in Afghanistan. But there have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and that's always been done firmly and respectfully.  The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves. My role, our responsibility, is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians' approach and be a positive example in the world.  President Trump. Okay.  Prime Minister Trudeau. Richard Latendresse [Groupe TVA].  Canada-U.S. Trade/Mexico-U.S. Trade/Job Creation  Q. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I'll ask my question in French first, and then, for you, I'll get—again in English.  [The reporter spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Mr. Prime Minister, if I heard you correctly, you said that Canadian businesses, Canadian workers are concerned for their businesses and for their work and jobs concerning the renegotiation of NAFTA. So what guarantees did you get from this government that we will keep our jobs and our businesses in the renegotiation of NAFTA?  [The reporter spoke in English as follows.]  Mr. President, again, during the last 3 months, you have denounced NAFTA. You have talked over and over about the Mexican portion of the agreement, very little about the Canadian one. My questions in two short part is, is Canada a fair trader? And when you talk about changes to NAFTA concerning Canada, are we again—are you talking about big changes or small changes? Thank you.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in French, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Prime Minister Trudeau. First of all, Richard, thank you for your question. It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds, our relationship with the United States. Goods and services do cross the border each way every single day, and this means a lot of millions of jobs for Canadians and good jobs for Canadians. So we are always focusing on these jobs, but there are also good jobs, millions of jobs, in the United States that depend on those relationships between our two countries.  So when we sit down as we did today, and as our teams will be doing in the weeks and months to come, we will be talking about how we can continue to create good jobs for our citizens on both sides of the border. And during this exercise, we continue to understand that we have to allow this free flow of goods and services, and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies, which is extremely positive for both our countries. And this is the focus that we will have in the coming weeks and months to come.  [Prime Minister Trudeau spoke in English as follows.]  Canadians are rightly aware of the fact that much of our economy depends on good working relationships with the United States, a good integration with the American economy. And the fact is, millions of good jobs on both sides of the border depend on the smooth and easy flow of goods and services and people back and forth across our border.  And both President Trump and I got elected on commitments to support the middle class, to work hard for people who need a real shot at success. And we know that by working together, by ensuring the continued effective integration of our two economies, we are going to be creating greater opportunities for middle class Canadians and Americans now and well into the future.  President Trump. I agree with that a hundred percent. We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. We'll be tweaking it. We'll be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries. It's a much less severe situation than what's taken place on the southern border. On the southern border, for many, many years, the transaction was not fair to the United States. It was an extremely unfair transaction. We're going to work with Mexico; we're going to make it a fair deal for both parties. I think that we're going to get along very well with Mexico; they understand, and we understand.  You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel the other day announce that because of what I've been doing and what I'm doing in terms of regulation—lowering taxes, et cetera—they're coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands of thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where they're doing the same. Jack Ma—we have so many people that want to come into the United States. It's actually very exciting.  I think it's going to be a very exciting period of time for the United States and for the workers of the United States, because they have been truly the forgotten man and forgotten women. It's not going to be forgotten anymore, believe me.  So our relationship with Canada is outstanding, and we're going to work together to make it even better. And as far as the southern border is concerned, we're going to get that worked  out. We're going to make it fair, but we are going to make it so that everybody is happy. It's very important to me.  Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel,2017-02-15,"The State of Israel is a symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression—I can think of no other state that's gone through what they've gone—and of survival in the face of genocide. We will never forget what the Jewish people have endured.  Your perseverance in the face of hostility, your open democracy in the face of violence, and your success in the face of tall odds, is truly inspirational. The security challenges faced by Israel are enormous, including the threat of Iran's nuclear ambitions, which I've talked a lot about. One of the worst deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal. My administration has already imposed new sanctions on Iran, and I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing—I mean ever—a nuclear weapon.  Our security assistance to Israel is currently at an alltime high, ensuring that Israel has the ability to defend itself from threats of which there are unfortunately many. Both of our countries will continue and grow. We have a long history of cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the fight against those who do not value human life. America and Israel are two nations that cherish the value of all human life.  This is one more reason why we reject unfair and one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations—just treated Israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly—or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel. Our administration is committed to working with Israel and our common allies in the region towards greater security and stability. That includes working toward a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The United States will encourage a peace and, really, a great peace deal. We'll be working on it very, very diligently. Very important to me also, something we want to do. But it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement. We'll be beside them; we'll be working with them.  As with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises. You know that, right? [Laughter]  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Both sides.  President Trump. I want the Israeli people to know that the United States stands with Israel in the struggle against terrorism. As you know, Mr. Prime Minister, our two nations will always condemn terrorist acts. Peace requires nations to uphold the dignity of human life and to be a voice for all of those who are endangered and forgotten.  Those are the ideals to which we all—and will always—aspire and commit. This will be the first of many productive meetings. And I, again, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with us today.  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. Prime Minister Netanyahu. President Trump, thank you for the truly warm hospitality you and Melania have shown me, my wife Sara, our entire delegation. I deeply value your friendship. To me, to the State of Israel, it was so clearly evident in the words you just spoke: Israel has no better ally than the United States. And I want to assure you, the United States has no better ally than Israel.  Our alliance has been remarkably strong, but under your leadership, I'm confident it will get even stronger. I look forward to working with you to dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field: in security, in technology, in cyber and trade and so many others. And I certainly welcome your forthright call to ensure that Israel is treated fairly in international forums and that the slander and boycotts of Israel are resisted mightily by the power and moral position of the United States of America.  As you have said, our alliance is based on a deep bond of common values and common interests. And increasingly, those values and interests are under attack by one malevolent force: radical Islamic terror. Mr. President, you've shown great clarity and courage in confronting this challenge head on. You call for confronting Iran's terrorist regime, preventing Iran from realizing this terrible deal into a nuclear arsenal. And you have said that the United States is committed to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons. You call for the defeat of ISIS. Under your leadership, I believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical Islam. And in this great task, as in so many others, Israel stands with you, and I stand with you.  Mr. President, in rolling back militant Islam, we can seize an historic opportunity, because for the first time in my lifetime, and for the first time in the life of my country, Arab countries in the region do not see Israel as an enemy, but increasingly, as an ally. And I believe that under your leadership, this change in our region creates an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen security and advance peace.  Let us seize this moment together. Let us bolster security. Let us seek new avenues of peace. And let us bring the remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States to even greater heights.  Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.  President Trump. Thank you. Again, thank you.  We'll take a couple of questions. David Brody, that's Christian Broadcasting. David.  Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn/Israel's West Bank Settlement Policy/Arab-Israeli Peace Process  Q. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. Both of you have criticized the Iran nuclear deal and at times even called for its repeal. I'm wondering if you're concerned at all as it relates to not just the National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, who is recently no longer here, but also some of those events that have been going on with communication in Russia—if that is going to hamper this deal at all, and whether or not it would keep Iran from becoming a nuclear state.  And secondly, on the settlement issue, are you both on the same page? How do you exactly term that, as it relates to the settlement issue? Thank you.  President Trump. Michael Flynn, General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he's been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media, in many cases. And I think it's really a sad thing that he was treated so badly. I think, in addition to that, from intelligence—papers are being leaked, things are being leaked. It's criminal action, criminal act, and it's been going on for a long time, before me. But now it's really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.  I think it's very, very unfair what's happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally—I stress that—illegally leaked. Very, very unfair.  As far as settlements, I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out. But I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made. I know that every President would like to. Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. And it wasn't possible, because they didn't do it.  But Bibi and I have known each other a long time, a smart man, great negotiator. And I think we're going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility. So let's see what we do.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Let's try it.  President Trump. Doesn't sound too optimistic, but that's—[laughter]. He's a good negotiator.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. That's the ""art of the deal."" [Laughter]  President Trump. I also want to thank—I also want to thank—Sara, could you please stand up? You're so lovely and you've been so nice to Melania. I appreciate it very much. Thank you.  Your turn.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Who is it? [Inaudible]—yes, please. Go ahead.  Arab-Israeli Peace Process/Location of U.S. Embassy in Israel  Q. Thank you very much. Mr. President, in your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up of the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration? And will you be willing to hear different ideas from the Prime Minister, as some of his partners are asking him to do, for example, annexation of parts of the West Bank and unrestricted settlement constructions? And one more question: Are you going to fulfill your promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem? And if so, when?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, did you come here tonight to tell the President that you're backing off the two-state solution?  Thank you.  President Trump. So I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like. [Laughter] I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. I can live with either one. I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two. But honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians—if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I'm happy with the one they like the best.  As far as the Embassy moving to Jerusalem, I'd love to see that happen. We're looking at it very, very strongly. We're looking at it with great care—great care, believe me. And we'll see what happens. Okay?  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you. I read yesterday that an American official said that if you ask five people what two states would look like, you'd get eight different answers. Well, Mr. President, if you ask five Israelis, you'd get 12 different answers. [Laughter]  But rather than deal with labels, I want to deal with substance. It's something I've hoped to do for years in a world that's absolutely fixated on labels and not on substance. So here's the substance: There are two prerequisites for peace that I laid out 2 years—several years ago, and they haven't changed.  First, the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state. They have to stop calling for Israel's destruction. They have to stop educating their people for Israel's destruction.  Second, in any peace agreement, Israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River. Because if we don't, we know what will happen—because otherwise, we'll get another radical Islamic, terrorist state in the Palestinian areas exploding the peace, exploding the Middle East.  Now, unfortunately, the Palestinians vehemently reject both prerequisites for peace. First, they continue to call for Israel's destruction: inside their schools, inside their mosques, inside the textbooks. You have to read it to believe it.  They even deny, Mr. President, our historical connection to our homeland. And I suppose you have to ask yourself: Why do—why are Jews called Jews? Well, the Chinese are called Chinese because they come from China. The Japanese are called Japanese because they come from Japan. Well, Jews are called Jews because they come from Judea. This is our ancestral homeland. Jews are not foreign colonialists in Judea.  So, unfortunately, the Palestinians not only deny the past, they also poison the present. They name public squares in honor of mass murderers who murdered Israelis and, I have to say, also murdered Americans. They fund—they pay monthly salaries to the families of murderers, like the family of the terrorist who killed Taylor Force, a wonderful young American, a West Point graduate, who was stabbed to death while visiting Israel.  So this is the source of the conflict, the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state in any boundary, this persistent rejectionism. That's the reason we don't have peace. Now, that has to change. I want it to change. Not only have I not abandoned these two prerequisites of peace; they've become even more important because of the rising tide of fanaticism that has swept the Middle East and has also, unfortunately, infected Palestinian society.  So I want this to change. I want those two prerequisites of peace—substance, not labels—I want them reinstated. But if anyone believes that I, as Prime Minister of Israel, responsible for the security of my country, would blindly walk into a Palestinian terrorist state that seeks the destruction of my country, they're gravely mistaken.  The two prerequisites of peace—recognition of the Jewish state, and Israel's security needs west of the Jordan—they remain pertinent. We have to look for new ways, new ideas on how to reinstate them and how to move peace forward. And I believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach from involving our newfound Arab partners in their pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the Palestinians.  And I greatly look forward to discussing this in detail with you, Mr. President, because I think that if we work together, we have a shot.  President Trump. And we have been discussing that, and it is something that is very different, hasn't been discussed before. And it's actually a much bigger deal, a much more important deal, in a sense. It would take in many, many countries, and it would cover a very large territory. So I didn't know you were going to be mentioning that, but that's—now that you did, I think it's a terrific thing, and I think we have some pretty good cooperation from people that in the past would never, ever have even thought about doing this. So we'll see how that works out.  Katie from Townhall [Katie Pavlich, Townhall.com]. Where's Katie? Right there. Katie.  Arab-Israeli Peace Process Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said in your earlier remarks that both sides will have to make compromises when it comes to a peace deal. You've mentioned a halt on settlements. Can you lay out a few more specific compromises that you have in mind, both for the Israelis and for the Palestinians?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, what expectations do you have from the new administration about how to either amend the Iran nuclear agreement or how to dismantle it altogether, and how to overall work with the new administration to combat Iran's increased aggression, not only in the last couple of months, but the past couple of years as well?  President Trump. It's actually an interesting question. I think that the Israelis are going to have to show some flexibility, which is hard; it's hard to do. They're going to have to show the fact that they really want to make a deal. I think our new concept that we've been discussing actually for a while is something that allows them to show more flexibility than they have in the past because you have a lot bigger canvas to play with. And I think they'll do that.  I think they very much would like to make a deal, or I wouldn't be happy, and I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be as optimistic as I am. I really think they—I can tell you from the standpoint of Bibi and from the standpoint of Israel, I really believe they want to make a deal and they'd like to see the big deal.  I think the Palestinians have to get rid of some of that hate that they're taught from a very young age. They're taught tremendous hate. I've seen what they're taught. And you can talk about flexibility there too, but it starts at a very young age, and it starts in the school room. And they have to acknowledge Israel; they're going to have to do that. There's no way a deal can be made if they're not ready to acknowledge a very, very great and important country. And I think they're going to be willing to do that also. But now I also believe we're going to have, Katie, other players at a very high level, and I think it might make it easier on both the Palestinians and Israel to get something done.  Okay? Thank you. Very interesting question. Thank you.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. You asked about Iran. One thing is preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons, something that President Trump and I think are deeply committed to do. And we are obviously going to discuss that.  I think, beyond that, President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the Presidency. He pointed out there are violations, Iranian violations, on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed."" The Palestinian—rather the Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said, well, our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country. No. They write on the missile in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed.""  So challenging Iran on its violations of ballistic missiles, imposing sanctions on Hizballah, preventing them, making them pay for the terrorism that they foment throughout the Middle East and beyond, well beyond, I think that's a change that is clearly evident. And since President Trump took office, I welcome that. I think it's—let me say this very openly: I think it's long overdue.  And I think that if we work together—and not just the United States and Israel, but so many others in the region who see eye to eye on the great magnitude and danger of the Iranian threat—then I think we can roll back Iran's aggression and danger. And that's something that is important for Israel, the Arab States, but I think it's vitally important for America. These guys are developing ICBMs. They're developing—they want to get to a nuclear arsenal, not a bomb, a hundred bombs. And they want to have the ability to launch them everywhere on Earth, and including—and especially, eventually—the United States.  So this is something that is important for all of us. I welcome the change, and I intend to work with President Trump very closely so that we can thwart this danger.  President Trump. Great. Do you have somebody?  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Moav [Moav Vardi, Israel's Channel 10]?  2016 Presidential Election/Anti-Semitism  Q. Mr. President, since your election campaign and even after your victory, we've seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States. And I wonder what you say to those among the Jewish community in the States and in Israel and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones.  And, Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree to what the President just said about the need for Israel to restrain or to stop settlement activity in the West Bank? And a quick follow-up on my friend's questions—simple question: Do you back off from your vision to the end of the conflict of two-state solution as you laid out in Bar-Ilan speech, or you still support it? Thank you.  President Trump. Well, I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had—306 electoral college votes. We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right? There was no way to 221, but then they said there's no way to 270. And there's tremendous enthusiasm out there.  I will say that we are going to have peace in this country. We are going to stop crime in this country. We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that's going on, because lot of bad things have been taking place over a long period of time.  I think one of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation. Very divided. And hopefully, I'll be able to do something about that. And I—you know, it was something that was very important to me.  As far as people—Jewish people—so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren. I think that you're going to see a lot different United States of America over the next 3, 4, or 8 years. I think a lot of good things are happening, and you're going to see a lot of love. You're going to see a lot of love. Okay? Thank you.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. I believe that the issue of the settlements is not the core of the conflict, nor does it really drive the conflict. I think it's an issue; it has to be resolved in the context of peace negotiations. And I think it also—we also are going to speak about it, President Trump and I, so we can arrive at an understanding so we don't keep on bumping into each other all the time on this issue. And we're going to discuss this.  On the question you said, you just came back with your question to the problem that I said. It's the label. What does Abu Mazen mean by two states, okay? What does he mean? A state that doesn't recognize the Jewish state? A state that basically is open for attack against Israel? What are we talking about? Are we talking about Costa Rica, or are we talking about another Iran?  So obviously, it means different things. I told you what are the conditions that I believe are necessary for an agreement: It's the recognition of the Jewish state, and it's Israel's—Israel's—security control of the entire area. Otherwise, we're just fantasizing. Otherwise, we'll get another failed state, another terrorist, Islamist dictatorship that will not work for peace, but work to destroy us but also destroy any hope—any hope—for a peaceful future for our people.  So I've been very clear about those conditions, and they haven't changed. I haven't changed. If you read what I said 8 years ago, it's exactly that. And I repeated that again, and again, and again. If you want to deal with labels, deal with labels. I'll deal with substance.  And finally, one—if I can respond to something that I know from personal experience. I've known President Trump for many years, and to allude to him, or to his people, his team, some of whom I've known for many years too. Can I reveal, Jared, how long we've known you? [Laughter] Well, he was never small. He was always big. [Laughter] He was always tall.  But I've known the President and I've known his family and his team for a long time, and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump. I think we should put that to rest.  President Trump. Thank you very much. Very nice. I appreciate that very much.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference,2017-02-16,"And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, a former Congressman, has just been approved—weeks late, I have to say that. Weeks, weeks late. Office of Management and Budget. And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, ""Never Trump."" And Paul just left, and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party, and hopefully, we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time, but it's very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.  I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time, we were—we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible. Just absolutely catastrophic, in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that.  And then, right after that, you prepare yourselves, we'll do some questions. Unless you have no questions; that's always a possibility.  I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last 4 weeks since my Inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don't think there's ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we've done.  A new Rasmussen poll, in fact—because the people get it; much of the media doesn't get it. They actually get it, but they don't write it. Let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is—to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, oh, that's good. Now it means that's good for jobs. Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league: Ford, General Motors, so many of them.  I'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present—which is an honor to have you this morning—because many of our Nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward, we can be a little bit different and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's okay too. Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, DC, along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don't talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people—tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press, honestly, is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.  I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is, we're talking about the power structure, we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort—not all the time—and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they're honest and fantastic. But much of it is not, they—the distortion. And we'll talk about it; you'll be able to ask me questions about it.  But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here, again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across Government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess—it's a mess—at home and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see what's going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places: low pay, low wages. Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look: the Middle East, a disaster; North Korea. We'll take care of it, folks. We're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know: I inherited a mess.  Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders—much of it you've covered—to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, of which there are many.  We've had great conversations with the United Kingdom—and meetings—Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada. Really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote women's business leaders and entrepreneurs. Very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka.  I have directed our defense community, headed by our great General, now Secretary Mattis—he's over there now, working very hard—to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group; now it's in large sections of the world. They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer, another mess I inherited.  And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, who's totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they're the world's top sponsor of terrorism. And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it's not properly solved now. It's one of the worst agreements I've ever seen drawn by anybody.  I've ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. I've had great support from the Senate. I've had great support from Congress, generally. We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. And I will tell you, that is my—I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment. And their equipment is old. I used it—I talked about it at every stop. Depleted—it's depleted. It won't be depleted for long. And I think one of the reasons I'm standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace, but it's peace through strength.  At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the Government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I'm keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders. Well, that's what I've been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They're so surprised—""Oh, he—having strong borders."" Well, that's what I've been talking about to the press and everybody else.  One promise after another, after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I'm doing probably aren't popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons. And then, coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.  I'm here, following through on what I pledged to do. That's all I'm doing. I put it out before the American people. Got 306 electoral college votes. I wasn't supposed to get 222. They said there's no way to get 222; 230 is impossible. Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before. So that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest electoral college win since Ronald Reagan.  In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason. And—but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I'll be in Melbourne, Florida, 5 o'clock on Saturday, and I heard—just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there.  I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos—chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I can't get my Cabinet approved, and they're outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coats who's there—one of the most respected men of the Senate—he can't get approved. How do you not approve him? He's been a colleague, highly respected, brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We're waiting for approval.  So we have a wonderful group of people that's working very hard, that's being very much misrepresented about, and we can't let that happen. So if the Democrats, who have—all you have to do is look at where they are right now—the only thing they can do is delay, because they've screwed things up royally, believe me.  Let me list to you some of the things that we've done in just a short period of time. I just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. So we'll go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming.  We've withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. We're going to make trade deals, but we're going to have one-on-one deals, bilateral. We're going to have one-on-one deals.  We've directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit—it's many, many years—and then, at the end of the process—they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense—and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me, but it's going to be a quick rejection, not going to take years. But mostly, it's going to be an acceptance. We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs. We don't want the jobs going to other countries.  We've imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential Federal workers. We've imposed a temporary moratorium on new Federal regulations. We've issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries, and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they're a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental—all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It's very important to me. But you don't need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.  We've stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing Federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We've directed the creation of a Task Force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation—take a look at Chicago and others—taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We've ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We're becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and we're not going to let it happen any longer.  We've undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our Nation and our tax dollars safe and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border. Met with General, now Secretary Kelly yesterday, and we're starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and it's going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else I've negotiated for the Government. And we're going to have a wall that works. We're not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke.  We've ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with Federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we've ordered an end to the policy of catch-and-release on the border. No more release, no matter who you are—release. We've begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day—court system has not made it easy for us—and are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.  We've taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judge's, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe—including reporters safe—and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. And I keep my campaign promises. And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that.  Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a Circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I've heard 80 percent—I find that hard to believe; that's just a number I heard—that they're overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that Circuit is—that Circuit is in chaos, and that Circuit is, frankly, in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further.  We're issuing a new executive XE ""Subject: Immigration and naturalization : Foreign nationals and refugees, U.S. admission policy"" action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we'll be going along the one path and, hopefully, winning that. At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.  We've also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines—thousands and thousands of jobs—and put new ""buy American"" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of Government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they're willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn, and they didn't say that. And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea. We put it in.  To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, DC, I've started by imposing a 5-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It's a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare—I mean, they fill up our rallies with people that you wonder how they get there, but they're not the Republican people that our Representatives are representing. So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. Going to bring our jobs back to this country, big league. It's already happening, but big league.  I've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson—is out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.  Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now, look, fair trade—not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we're not going to let that happen anymore. Now, every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do.  Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know. You were here. General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here.  Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. And there will be many, many more. Many more. These are a few that we're naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades—decades and decades and decades, folks. And we're not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.  And one more thing: I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a Justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution. Highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that, but he'll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.  This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it: There has never been a Presidency that's done so much in such a short period of time. And we haven't even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. Got some very big things are going to be announced next week.  So we're just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5 p.m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let's take some questions.  Mara [Mara Liasson, NPR]. Mara, go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.  Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn/Leaking of Classified Information/News Media  Q. Mr. President, did you fire Mike Flynn?  The President. Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who—there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given.  He didn't have to do that, because what he did wasn't wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That's the real problem. And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this—they know nothing about it. They weren't in Russia; they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call. It's all fake news. It's all fake news.  The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara—and I think it's very important—the illegal giving out classified information. And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much. I'll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, that's nice. Spoke to the President of Mexico. I had a good call. All of a sudden, it's out for the world to see. It's supposed to be secret. It's supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place.  The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this, and I'm saying—the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it's an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really ashamed. Yes, go ahead.  Ms. Liasson. Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost 2 weeks?  The President. Because when I looked at the information, I said, I don't think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, he looked at the information. He said, huh, that's fine; that's what they're supposed to do. They're supposed to be—and he didn't just call Russia. He called and spoke to, both ways—I think there were 30-some-odd countries. He's doing the job.  You know, he was just doing his job. But the thing is, he didn't tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didn't remember. So either way, it wasn't very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.  But he didn't tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didn't remember. And that just wasn't acceptable to me.  Russia/2016 Presidential Election/News Media  Q. President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I'm looking for some clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian Government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations?  The President. Yes, well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long, front page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was—it's a joke. And the people mentioned in the story—I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren't even a part, really—I mean, they were such a minor part, they—I hadn't spoken to them. I think the one person, I don't think I've ever spoken to him. I don't think I've ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I don't think I ever met him. Now, it's possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don't think I ever met him. I didn't talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke.  The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call, look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he'd represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia—but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that. That's Mr. Manafort, who's, by the way—who's, by the way, a respected man. He's a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine Government, or somebody. But everybody—people knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people—and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it, because that's not good for their stories.  So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the Inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all other countries. So that's the extent.  Russia is fake news. Russia, this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration, because they're there—because we have our new people going in place right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo is now—taken control of the CIA; James Comey at FBI. Dan Coats is waiting to be approved. I mean, he is a Senator, and a highly respected one. And he's still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in.  And just while you're at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Times's story yesterday. And it talked about—you saw it, front page. So Director of National Intelligence just put out—Acting—a statement: ""Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community""—this was just given to us—""is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.""  So they took this front page story out of the Wall Street Journal—top—and they just wrote the story, that it's not true. And I'll tell you something, I'll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but I've never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story like that in the Wall Street Journal without asking me? Or how do they write a story in the New York Times, put it on front page? That was like that story they wrote about the women and me: front page, big massive story. And it was nasty.  And then, they called. They said, ""We never said that. We like Mr. Trump."" They called up my office—we like Mr. Trump; we never said that. And it was totally—they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you—totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction. And frankly, I then went on to other things.  Okay, go ahead.  2016 Presidential Election  Q. Mr. President—excuse me.  The President. You okay?  Q. You said—I am, just wanted to get untangled. Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes. In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.  The President. Well, I'm talking about Republican. Yes.  Q. President Obama, 332——  The President. Yes.  Q. ——and George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President. So why should Americans trust——  The President. Well, no, I was told—I was given that information. I don't know. I was just given. We had a very, very big margin.  Q. I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you accused the information they receive of being fake, when you're providing information that's fake?  The President. Well, I don't know. I was given that information. I was given—I've, actually, I've seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that? Q. You're the President.  The President. Okay, thank you. [Laughter] I—that's, good answer. Yes.  Q. Mr. President, thank you so much.  The President. Good, sure.  U.S. Intelligence Community/Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn/Leaking of Classified Information  Q. Good afternoon to you, sir. Can you tell us, in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn—where there's no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing?  And further than that, sir, you've said on a couple of occasions this morning you were going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks.  The President. We are.  Q. Can we ask what you're doing to do? And also, we've heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg. What can you tell us about that?  The President. Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats—hopefully, soon—Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they're in position. So I hope that we'll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man. And he has offered his services, and it's something we may take advantage of. But I don't think we'll need that at all because of the fact that I think that we're going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.  As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came—Don McGahn, White House Counsel—and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong. Really didn't think—it was really what happened after that, but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either, because I waited a period of time, and I started to think about it. I said, well, I don't see—to me, he was doing the job.  The information was provided by—who I don't know, Sally Yates—and I was a little surprised, because I said, doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there. But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as the actual making the call—in fact, I've watched various programs, and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out, he was just doing his job.  So—and I do—and by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man.  Yes, Jon.  Q. On the leaks, sir——  The President. Yes, go ahead, finish off, then I'll get you, Jon.  Q. I'm sorry, what will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today—— The President. Yes, we're looking at them very, very seriously. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we're—I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies. I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example. So we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act.  You know what I say, when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment. When I was called out on Mexico, I was—honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said, you know, it doesn't make sense, that won't happen. But that wasn't that important to call; it was fine. I could show it to the world, and he could show it to the world—the President who is a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said, that's terrible that it was leaked, but it wasn't that important. But then, I said, I mean, I said, what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea? What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information—very important, very—I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?  So I don't want classified information getting out to the public. And in a way, that was almost a test. So I'm dealing with Mexico. I'm dealing with Argentina. We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times. And I'm saying, what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We've got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.  Yes, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News].  News Media/The President's Cabinet Nominations  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?  The President. Well, the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said; you saw it. And the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake, because so much of the news is fake.  So one thing that I felt it was very important to do—and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for—well, maybe a little bit, but—than reporters, than good reporters. It's very important to me and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true. And over a course of time, I'll make mistakes, and you'll write badly, and I'm okay with that. But I'm not okay when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN—it's so much anger and hatred, and just the hatred. I don't watch it anymore because it's very good—he's saying no. It's okay, Jim. It's okay, Jim. You'll have your chance. But I watch others too. You're not the only one, so don't feel badly.  But I think it should be straight. I think it should be—I think it would be, frankly, more interesting. I know how good everybody's ratings are right now, but I think they'd actually be—I think they'd actually be better. People—I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that's right. I don't know, Peter [Alexander, NBC News], is that one right? Because, you know, I think they have lower—I heard, lower than Congress.  But honestly, the public would appreciate it. I'd appreciate it. Again, I don't mind bad stories when it's true. But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think we're setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I'm looking—some of them had them approved immediately. I'm going forever, and I still have a lot of people that we're waiting for.  And that's all they're doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he's got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And you know, I think they'd be better served by approving and making sure that they're happy and everybody is good. And sometimes, I mean—I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way. And that's okay. That's fine.  But I think it would—I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it.  Yes, go ahead, Jim.  Mr. Karl. The first part of my question on contacts, do you definitively say that nobody——  The President. Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there. I have no anything.  Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give—they're not giving classified information. They're giving stuff—what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates—which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.  Can you imagine—seriously—can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair—[laughter]—okay? ""He should be put in the electric""—you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay? Maybe not you, Jon.  Yes, we'll do you next, Jim. I'll do you next. Yes, yes?  Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn  Ms. Liasson. Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to clarify one other thing.  The President. Sure.  Q. Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian Ambassador?  The President. No, I didn't. No, I didn't.  Q. [Inaudible]—prior to the Inauguration——  The President. No, I didn't. But Mike——  Q. Did you fire him because—[inaudible].  The President. Excuse me. No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn't doing it. I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him because that's his job.  And it came out that way—and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job. And I agreed with him. And since then, I've watched many other people say that.  No, I didn't direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn't do it, okay?  Jim [Jim Acosta, CNN].  WikiLeaks/2016 Presidential Election/News Media  Q. Mr. President, thank you very much. And just for the record, we don't hate you, I don't hate you.  The President. Okay.  Q. So just wanted to pass that along.  The President. Ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?  Q. If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir.  The President. Well, not too many. We do have other people. You do have other people, and your ratings aren't as good as some of the other people that are waiting.  Q. They're pretty good right now, actually Mr. President.  The President. Okay. Go ahead, Jim.  Q. If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that at one point.  The President. I was okay with it.  Q. You said you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference, you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 e-mails. I'm wondering, sir, if you——  The President. Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but that's okay.  Q. Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.  The President. No, no, but I did say 30, but it was actually higher than that.  Q. If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.  The President. Okay, fair question. Ready?  Q. So if I may ask you that——  The President. No, no, but are you—let me do one at a time.  Q. If I may ask a follow-up——  The President. Do you mind?  Q. Yes, sir. The President. All right. So in one case, you're talking about highly classified information. In the other case you're talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn't classified information.  But in one case, you're talking about classified. Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong—at my suggestion—and I give Reince great credit for this—at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I don't want to be hacked. And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us, and they failed.  The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked, and terrible things came. And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so—they were—when I heard some of those things, I said—I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page. It wasn't even in the papers.  Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been the headline in every newspaper.  I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate, and she should have reported herself. Why didn't Hillary Clinton announce that, ""I'm sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it's inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""?  Q. And if I may follow up on that—just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about—you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there is a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?  The President. No, the reporting is fake.  Q. And if I may ask——  The President. Look, look——  Q. I just want to ask one other—yes, sir.  The President. Jim, you know what it is? Here's the thing. The public isn't—they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if it's true or false, because they're not involved. I'm involved. I've been involved with this stuff all my life. But I'm involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not.  I just see many, many untruthful things. And I'll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word ""tone."" The tone is such hatred. I'm really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such—I do get good ratings, you have to admit that. The tone is such hatred.  I watched this morning, a couple of the networks, and I have to say ""Fox & Friends"" in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very—not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. It's the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look—the hatred. The—I mean, sometimes——  Q. [Inaudible]—don't hate you, sir. The President. ——sometimes, somebody gets. Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o'clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is, he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.  Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I'm amazed by it. And I just think you'd be a lot better off—I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN.  I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning, in the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's brutal.  Now, they'll take this news conference. I'm actually having a very good time, okay? But they'll take this news conference—don't forget that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.  Q. [Inaudible]  The President. No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people, that's for sure. [Laughter]  But I am having a good time. Tomorrow they will say, ""Donald Trump rants and raves at the press."" I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you, you're dishonest people. But I'm not ranting and raving. I love this. I'm having a good time doing it. But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: ""Donald Trump Rants and Raves."" I'm not ranting and raving.  Q. But I'm—if I may just——  The President. Go ahead.  Q. One more follow-up because——  The President. Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter?  Q. Just because of this——  The President. Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down.  Q. Just because of the attack——  The President. We'll get it.  Q. Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir——  The President. I'm changing it from fake news though.  Q. Doesn't that undermine——  The President. Very fake news now. [Laughter]  Q. I know, but aren't you——  The President. Okay, go ahead.  Q. Real news, Mr. President. Real news.  The President. And you're not related to our new—— Q. I am not related, sir, no. [Laughter] I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say, Mr. President.  The President. I looked—you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta. [Laughter]  Q. I'm sure you checked that out, sir.  The President. No, I checked it. I said—they said, no, sir. I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree. [Laughter]  Q. But aren't you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don't like ""fake news""? Why not just say it's a story I don't like?  The President. I do that. No, I do that.  Q. When you call it fake news, you're undermining confidence——  The President. No, no, I do it.  Q. ——in our news media.  The President. Here's the thing.  Q. Isn't that important?  The President. Okay, I understand—and you're right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes, I'll say, wow, that's going to be a great story, and I'll get killed. I know what's good and bad. I'd be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what's good. I know what's bad.  And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive. Sometimes, something that should be very positive, they'll make okay. They'll even make it negative. So I understand it, so—because I'm there. I know what was said. I know who is saying it. I'm there. So it's very important to me.  Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it's so important to the public to get an honest press. The press—the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don't know. But they don't believe you.  If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster; I would be your biggest fan in the world—including bad stories about me. But if you go—as an example, you're CNN—I mean, it's story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing: chaos. There's zero chaos. We are running—this is a fine-tuned machine. And Reince happens to be doing a good job. But half of his job is putting out lies by the press.  I said to him yesterday, they—you know, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks. But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I'm saying, here's my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, we won the election, right? We won the Presidency. We got some Senators. We got some—all over the country, you take a look, he's done a great job. And I said to myself, you know—and I said to somebody that was in the room—I said, you take a look at Reince, he's working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. I mean, they're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame, because he'd rather be working on health care. He'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim. I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. Now, I sort of understand there's a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody, for whatever reason. But—and I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair. And that's why the public sees it—they see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows, and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart. They understand it.  Okay, yes, go ahead. Go ahead.  Russia-U.S. Relations  Q. We have no doubt that you believe this story is fake news. But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And secondly——  The President. I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public believes. That's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now, tomorrow you'll say, ""Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia; this is terrible."" It's not terrible, it's good.  We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons and other things. Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks? Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton—that was a reset. Remember? It said ""reset.""  Now, if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly. And I told him, I said, I know politically it's probably not good for me. Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it's so great. That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia.  Now, you've had a lot of Presidents that haven't taken that tact. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So if I can—now, I love to negotiate things. I do it really well and all that stuff, but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people—the false, horrible, fake reporting—makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably, Putin said, you know—he's sitting behind his desk, and he's saying, you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it's got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story. Okay? And that's a shame. Because if we could get along with Russia—and by the way, China and Japan and everyone—if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing. Tax Reform/Health Care Reform  Q. Tax reform—[inaudible]  Q. Mr. President, since you——  The President. Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare; we're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like—frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner. So we'll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March. And after that, we're going to come up—and we're doing very well on tax reform.  Yes.  Russia-U.S. Relations  Q. Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.  The President. Okay.  Q. You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.  The President. Not good.  Q. There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation——  The President. Not good, not good.  Q. ——of the agreement between the two countries. And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.  The President. Not good.  Q. I listened to you——  The President. Excuse me——  Q. ——during the campaign——  The President. ——excuse me, when did it happen? It happened when—if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the United States. There's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the public—you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say—you would say—oh, isn't that wonderful. But I know you well enough. Then, you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn't have done that. Look, all of the things——  Q. I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those——  The President. Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second.  Q. I'm just trying to find out what you're doing to do about them, Mr. President.  The President. All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people. Go ahead.  Q. How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them?  The President. Just the way I said it.  Q. Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?  The President. I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.  Yes, I think that I've already——  Q. Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?  The President. No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.  Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might; we might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough—the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.  If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along—and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are they. I've been briefed. And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say, because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They're a very powerful nuclear country, and so are we.  If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.  Q. So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are——  The President. Who did I say is not good?  Q. No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened, and each one of them you said, they're not good.  The President. No, it's not good, but they happened.  Q. But do they damage the relationship?  The President. They all happened recently.  Q. Do they undermine this country's ability to work with Russia?  The President. They all happened recently, and I understand what they're doing, because they're doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I'm not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don't, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Okay.  But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I'm close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She's close to Russia. Q. Can we——  The President. I gave—you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.  Q. Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?  The President. Yes, I'm not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don't talk about military response. I don't say I'm going into Mosul in 4 months. ""We are going to attack Mosul in 4 months."" Then, 3 months later: ""We are going to attack Mosul in 1 month."" ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul."" In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because—I don't talk about military, and I don't talk about certain other things. You're going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I'd say that.  Q. Right.  The President. So I don't have to tell you——  Q. There will be a response?  The President. I don't want to be one of these guys that say, ""Yes, here's what we're going to do."" I don't have to do that.  Q. There will be a——  The President. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea  Q. In other words, there will be a response, Mr. President?  The President. Wait a minute. I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do in North Korea. And I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn't know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship—the Russian ship, as an example—I'm not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won't have to do anything. But I'm not going to tell you. Okay.  Q. Thanks.  Q. Can I just ask you—thank you very much, Mr. President—the Trump——  The President. Where are you from?  Q. BBC.  The President. Okay. Here's another beauty. [Laughter]  Q. That's a good line. Impartial, free, and fair.  The President. Yes, sure.  Q. Mr. President——  The President. Just like CNN, right?  The President's Executive Order on Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States  Q. On the travel ban—we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of Government, that fine-tuned—— The President. Yes, I do. I do. And let me tell you about the travel——  Q. Were there any mistakes in that?  The President. Wait, wait, wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court. We got a bad decision. We had a court that's been overturned—again, maybe wrong, but I think it's 80 percent of the time. A lot. We had a bad decision. We're going to keep going with that decision. We're going to put in a new Executive order next week sometime. But we had a bad decision. That's the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban.  You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that, the only problem that we had is, we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us, what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.  Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same Executive order, but said one thing—and I said this to my people: Give them a 1-month period of time. But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month—the bad ones. You do agree, there are bad people out there, right? They're not everybody that's like you. You have some bad people out there.  So Kelly said, you can't do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it. I said, how about 1 week? He said, no good. You've got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they don't have time to come in. Now, nobody ever reports that, but that's why we did it quickly.  Now, if I would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect. The problem is, we would have wasted a lot of time and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.  Q. But just——  The President. Now, in the meantime, we're vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help, and we need help by getting that Executive order passed.  Q. Just a brief follow-up, and if it's so urgent, why not introduce——  The President. Yes, go ahead.  Russia/2016 Presidential Election  Q. Thank you. I just was hoping that we could get a yes-or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?  The President. Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing. So that's one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been——  Q. During the election?  The President. No, no, nobody that I know of. Nobody——  Q. So you're not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?  The President. Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question? Q. Can you just say yes or no on it?  The President. Russia is a ruse. Yes, I know you have to get up and ask a question—so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia, haven't made a phone call to Russia in years. Don't speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn't, I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election—I told you this—and he called me on the Inauguration a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one—lasted for a pretty long period of time. I'm sure you probably get it, because it was classified, so I'm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does.  Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine or people that—whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.  Q. But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?  The President. I have—you know what, he said no. I can only tell you what he—now, he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who's a good man also, by the way—Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.  How much longer should we stay here, folks? Five more minutes, is that okay? Five?  Q. Mr. President, on national security——  The President. Wait, let's see, who's—I want to find a friendly reporter. Used to say it was Joe—are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait, wait—watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. Go ahead.  Anti-Semitism  Q. I've been here through the entire campaign, Mr. President.  The President. Go ahead.  Q. So, first of all, my name is Jake Turx from Ami magazine. And I, despite what some of my colleagues may have been reporting, I haven't seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the—anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic. We understand that you have Jewish grandchildren; you are their zayde.  The President. Thank you.  Q. However, what we are concerned about, and what we haven't really heard being addressed, is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the Government is planning to take care of it. There has been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to——  The President. You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question. And it's not. It's not. Not a simple question, not a fair question. Okay, sit down. I understand the rest of your question. So here's the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism—the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican.  Q. [Inaudible]  The President. Quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about—he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question. So you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something—that I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question, because people that know me—and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday—did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I've known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.  So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.  Yes, go ahead. Go ahead.  Q. Thank you. I'm Lisa from the PBS——  The President. See, it just shows you about the press, but that's the way the press is.  Q. Thank you, Mr. President.  The President. Good.  Q. Lisa Desjardins from the PBS NewsHour.  The President. Good.  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Policy/Immigration  Q. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the Executive order you plan for next week, even its broad outlines?  The President. Yes.  Q. Will it be focused on specific countries?  The President. It's a very fair question.  Q. And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration——  The President. Right.  Q. ——what is your plan? Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?  The President. We're going to show great heart. DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it's one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases—not in all cases. In some of the cases, they're having DACA, and they're gang members, and they're drug dealers too. But you have some absolutely incredible kids—I would say mostly—they were brought here in such a way—it's a very, very tough subject.  We are going to deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.  But the DACA situation is a very, very—it's a very difficult thing for me. Because, you know, I love these kids. I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do. And you know, the law is rough. I'm not talking about new laws. I'm talking the existing law is very rough. It's very, very rough.  As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the—what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision. We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new Executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. Okay?  Q. Mr. President——  The First Lady  Q. Mr. President, First Lady Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office.  The President. Yes.  Q. And she does a lot of great work for the country as well. Can you talk a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country? And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you and the rest of the——  The President. Now, that's what I call a nice question. [Laughter] That is very nice. Who are you with?  Q. UNF News, it's an independent——  The President. Good. I'm going to start watching, all right. Thank you very much.  Melania is terrific. She was here last night. We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba, because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans. And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding. That's right, she just opened up the Visitors Center, in other words, touring of the White House.  She, like others that she's working with, feel very, very strongly about women's issues, women's difficulties—very, very strongly. And she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens, because she gets so unfairly maligned. The things they say—I've known her for a long time. She was a very successful person. She was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say—and I've known her for a long time—the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.  I'd just tell you this: I think she's going to be a fantastic First Lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money. They're not doing this for pay. They're doing this because they feel it, both of them. And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school—because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left—she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. Okay, thank you. That's a very nice question. Go ahead.  Q. Mr. President.  The President. Yes. Hi—oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that's okay.  Q. No, it's not going to be a bad question.  The President. Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead.  The President's Urban Policy Agenda/Congressional Black Caucus/Representative Elijah E. Cummings  Q. Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you—you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign.  The President. Fix the inner cities, right?  Q. Fixing the inner cities. What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU Executive order that's coming out this afternoon? Now, see, it wasn't bad, was it?  The President. That was very professional and very good.  Q. I'm very professional, yes.  The President. Yes, well, we'll be announcing the order in a little while, and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it will be something, I think, that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.  As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did much higher than people thought I was going to get, and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.  So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities: having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible—you know it takes a long time. It's taken a hundred years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved, many of them, very badly.  But we're going to be working very hard on health and health care, very, very hard on education. And also, we're going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places, and it's so sad when you look at the crime. You have people—and I've seen this, and I've sort of witnessed it. In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They're living in hell. We can't let that happen. So we're going to be very, very strong.  It's a great question, and it's a very difficult situation, because it's been many, many years. It's been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there—Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and they're living in hell.  I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There's one Chicago that's incredible, luxurious and all, and safe. There's another Chicago that's worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about and that you talk about every night on the newscasts. So we're going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.  Q. Well, when you say—when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well  as——  The President. Am I going include who?  Q. Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus——  The President. Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting?  Q. ——as well as——  The President. Do you want to set up the meeting?  Q. No, no, no.  The President. Are they friends of yours?  Q. I'm just a reporter.  The President. No, go ahead, set up the meeting.  Q. I know some of them, but I'm sure they're watching right now.  The President. Let's go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it's great—the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it's great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I can't—move it—might be bad for me politically, I can't have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone. Very nice guy.  Q. I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.  The President. He wanted it. But we called, called, called—they can't make a meeting with him. Every day, I walk in, I said, I would like to meet with him. Because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that—some other lightweight—[laughter]—he was probably told—he was probably told, don't meet with Trump, it's bad politics. And that's part of the problem in this country.  Okay, one more. Go ahead.  Q. Yes, I have two questions, both——  The President. No, no. One question. Two, we can't handle. This room can't handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.  U.S. Political Divisions  Q. I'll follow up on my colleague's question about anti-Semitism. It's not about your personality or your beliefs. We're talking about a rise in anti-Semitism around the country, some of it by supporters in your name. What do you——  The President. And some of it—and can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don't think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you'll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump; they're put up by the other side, and you think it's, like, playing it straight. No. But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They'll do signs, and they'll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won't be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. Okay.  Q. Can I ask one more follow-up?  Q. Mr. President, one more question, sir.  The President. Go ahead.  Political Tensions in the U. S.  Q. You are the President now. What are you going to do about it?  The President. Who is that? Where is that? Oh, stand up. You can——  Q. What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?  The President. Oh, I'm working on it. No, I'm working on it very hard.  Q. Are you going to give a speech?  The President. No, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for 8 years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama. Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided—I didn't come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here.  We're going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked—I thought it was a very good question—was about the inner cities. I mean, that's part of it. But we're going to work on education. We're going to work on lack—you know, we're going to stop—we're going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials. We're going to try and stop crime. We're not going to try and stop, we're going to stop crime.  But it's very important to me. But this isn't Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went 8 years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try—I will do everything within my power—to fix that.  I want to thank everybody very much. It's a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany,2017-03-17,"We just concluded a productive meeting with the German and American companies to discuss workforce development and vocational training. Very important words. Germany has done an incredible job training the employees and future employees and employing its manufacturing and industrial workforce. It's crucial that we provide our American workers with a really great employment outlook, and that includes making sure that we harness the full potential of women in our economy.  My administration is in the process of rebuilding the American industrial base. A stronger America is in the interests, believe me, of the world as a whole. I reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my strong support for NATO, as well as the need for our NATO allies to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States. These nations must pay what they owe.  During our meeting, I thanked Chancellor Merkel for the German Government's commitment to increase defense spending and work toward contributing at least 2 percent of GDP. I want to thank the Chancellor for her leadership in supporting NATO and its efforts in Afghanistan. This has come at significant cost, including the lives of over 50 German soldiers, whose sacrifice we greatly honor.  I also appreciate Chancellor Merkel's leadership, along with the French President, to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, where we ideally seek a peaceful solution.  Most importantly, our two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism and to defeat ISIS. I applaud Chancellor Merkel for Germany's contributions, both civilian and military, as a counter-ISIS coalition member.  We also recognize that immigration security is national security. We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism, and violence inside our borders. Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.  Over lunch, the Chancellor and I will talk about our economic partnership. We must work together towards fair and reciprocal trade policies that benefit both of our peoples. Millions of hard-working U.S. citizens have been left behind by international commerce, and together, we can shape a future where all of our citizens have a path to financial security.  The United States will respect historic institutions, and we will also recognize the right of free people to manage their own destiny.  The close friendship between America and Germany is built on our shared values. We cherish individual rights, we uphold the rule of law, and we seek peace among nations. Our alliance is a symbol of strength and cooperation to the world. It is the foundation of a very, very hopeful future. Thank you.  Chancellor Merkel. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and privilege to be here today in the White House, together with President Donald Trump, and have a first, personal, one-on-one meeting and an exchange of views.  In the period leading up to this visit, I've always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another, and I think our conversation proved this. We talked about the international situation. We talked about also apprenticeship programs when we met with CEOs and apprentices around a round table.  As regards the shared interests that we have, let me look back into the past. We, the Germans, owe a lot to the United States of America, particularly as regards the economic rise of Germany. This was primarily due to the help through the Marshall Plan. We were also able to regain German unity after decades of the United States standing up for this, together with other allies, and standing by our side during the period of the cold war. And we are very gratified to know that today we can live in peace and freedom as a unified country due to that.  So I was gratified to know that the President had aligned how important he thinks NATO is. NATO is of prime importance for us, and it was not without very good reason that we said during our summit meeting in Wales that also Germany needs to increase its expense—expenditure. We committed to this 2-percent goal until 2024. Last year we increased our defense spending by 8 percent, and we're going to work together again and again on this.  And we said that, obviously, defense and security has a lot of different assets and facets to it. One the one hand, it's supporting missions in Africa, for example. It's also promoting development assistance, but it's also helping missions in Africa, for example, in trying to stand up for their own safety and security.  We continue to be in conversation. What was important for us today was that we were able to talk about Afghanistan, talk about, what—as the President quite rightly said, the continuing mission of Germany in Afghanistan. I am very glad that the United States are intending to continue to commit to the Afghan mission as well.  Together, we fight against Islamist terrorism. Germany is going to step up its work and is going to continue its work in Afghanistan and also in Syria. We're going to monitor the situation there very closely. We're going to work on political solutions in Syria, but also in Libya—what we talked about.  I am very gratified to know that the American administration and also the President, personally, commits himself to the Minsk process. We need to come to a solution of this problem. There has to be a safe and secure solution for Ukraine, but the relationship with Russia has to be improved as well, once the situation there on the ground is clarified.  Minsk is a good basis, but unfortunately, we haven't made yet the headway that we want to. But we are going to work together with our experts in the next few months to come on this issue.  I am also here in my capacity as G-20 President. You know that we will be hosting the G-20 visit—the G-20 summit—sorry—this year, and I'm very pleased that the President has committed to attending this summit. We're going to talk at some length over lunch about the issues. We say this has—trade has to be rendered fairer; there has to be a win-win situation. We can talk about the details of that. We've already seen today when we had an exchange with our CEOs and also with our apprentices what sort of potential we can tap, what sort our potential our two economies have. It's very moving to see, particularly meeting with these young people, what sort of work towards the future is being done by our companies there.  So, particularly in this period where we are transiting from traditional manufacturing to industry—[inaudible]—capacity-building skills are so important, incidentally, not only for young people, but also for those who maybe have lost their jobs and need to be reskilled in order to find a job again. And that is an issue I know is very important for you here in the United States, but it's also important for us in Germany.  So I can say there are a number of issues where we will continue to cooperate very closely on the level of our experts, but also on our level. We had a very good first exchange of views, so I'm very much looking forward to the talks we will have over lunch.  Thank you.  President Trump. Thank you very much. We'll do a couple of questions.  Mark Halperin [NBC News].  Health Care Reform  Q. Mr. President, thank you. A lot of Americans now have anxiety, like 8 years ago, as the Government here debates what to do about health care. So I'm wondering if you can tell people what your bottom lines are, what's nonnegotiable. You've talked in the past about saying, no one should be denied health insurance if they can't afford it. And you've talked about——  Interpreter. The gentleman needs to use a microphone.  Q. [Inaudible] Are those part of your bottom line? Would you veto any piece of legislation that violated any those?  Madame Chancellor if I could ask you, President Trump has got a different style than most recent, past U.S. Presidents. I'm wondering what you think of that style, if you think it's good for the world or if you've got any reservations about it. Thank you both.  President Trump. Thank you, Mark. We just have a really wonderful group of people meeting later. We met with 12 pretty much ""noes"" in Congress—you saw that a little while ago—and they went from all ""noes"" to all ""yeses."" And we have a lot of ""yeses"" coming in. It's all coming together. We're going to have great health care. It's going to be passed, I believe, I think substantially and pretty quickly. It's coming together beautifully. You have conservative groups; you have other groups. Everybody wants certain things. In the end, we're going to have a great health care plan.  Now, I have to tell you that Obamacare is a disaster. It's failing. I was in Tennessee—we had a tremendous crowd the other night—and they have half of the State is uncovered. The insurance companies have left, and the other half has one insurance company, and that will probably be bailing out pretty soon also. They'll have nobody. You have many States where they have one. You have a lot of places now where they'll have none. Obamacare will fail. It will fold. It will close up very, very soon if something isn't done.  I've often said politically, the best thing I can do is absolutely nothing. Wait 1 year and then even the Democrats will come say, please, please, you got to help us. But it's not the right thing to do for the people. We have a great plan. We have a plan that's getting more and more popular with the Republican base, with the conservative base, and with people generally. The press has covered it very inaccurately. People are truly covered well, and I think it's going to be something that's going to be a model to be looked upon.  Q. [Inaudible]—that were nonnegotiable for you, Mr. President?  President Trump. I'll tell you after we're finished. [Laughter]  Chancellor Merkel. Thank you very much. Well, I'm here as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. I represent German interests. I speak with the President of the United States, who, well, stands up for, as is right, American interests. That is our task, respectively. And I must say that I was very gratified to know the very warm and gracious hospitality with which I have been received here.  We held a conversation where we were trying to address also those areas where we disagree, but to try to bring people together, try to show what is our vantage point, what is the American vantage point, and then try to find a compromise which is good for both sides. Because we need to be fair with each other. Each and every one is expecting for his or her leader that something good comes out of it for their own people.  For Germany, I can say, well, people are different. People have different abilities, have different characteristics—traits of character, have different origins, have found their way into politics along different pathways. All that is, well, diversity, which is good. Sometimes, it's difficult to find compromises, but that's what we've been elected for. If everything just went like that and without problem, well you didn't need politicians to do these jobs.  Ms. Dunz, please.  Trade  Q. Kristina Dunz from the German Press Agency. Madam Chancellor, given the experience of the GDR, you are always saying that you are so confident that walls can fall also. For how dangerous do you think this isolationist policy of the U.S. President is, what with the import of terrorists that he plans? And also, with the fact that he doesn't think that the EU—doesn't deal with the EU in a very respectful way?  And then, Mr. President, America First, don't you think that this is going to weaken also the European Union? And why are you so scared of diversity in the news and in the media that you speak so often of fake news and that things, after all, in the end, cannot be proven? For example, the fact that you have been wiretapped by Mr. Obama?.  President Trump. Should I go first? [Laughter] Nice, friendly reporter. [Laughter] Well, first of all, I don't believe in an isolationist policy, but I also believe a policy of trade should be a fair policy. And the United States has been treated very, very unfairly by many countries over the years. And that's going to stop.  But I'm not an isolationist. I'm a free trader, but I'm also a fair trader. And our free trade has led to a lot of bad things happening; you look at the deficits that we have, and you look at all of the accumulation of debt. We're a very powerful company—country. We're a very strong, very strong country. We'll soon be at a level that we perhaps have never been before. Our military is going to be strengthened; it's been depleted. But I am a trader. I am a fair trader. I am a trader that wants to see good for everybody, worldwide. But I am not an isolationist by any stretch of the imagination. So I don't know what newspaper you're reading, but I guess that would be another example of, as you say, fake news. Okay.  Chancellor Merkel. Well, allow me, if I may, to put it in the following terms. We haven't yet had time to talk at a great length about economic issues, but I would say that the success of Germany in the economic area, but also on security and peace—that the success of Germans have always been one where the German success is one side of the coin, and the other side of the coin has been European unity and European integration. That's something of which I'm deeply convinced. And I'm not only saying this back home, I'm saying this here. I'm saying it in the United Nations—in the United States and also here in Washington in my talks with the President.  Secondly, I believe that globalization ought to be shaped in an open-minded way, but also in a very fair way. Freedom of movement within the European Union, for example, is a very important element of our economic progress, of peace; has been for many, many decades. The European countries for many, many centuries waged wars against each other. We have to protect our external borders because—and there we have to work on the basis of mutual interests with our neighbors.  Migration, immigration, integration has to be worked on, obviously. Traffickers have to be stopped. But this has to be done while looking at the refugees as well, giving them opportunities to shape their own lives where they are; help countries who right now are not in an ability to do so, sometimes because they have civil war. I think that's the right way of going about it. And this is obviously what we have an exchange of views about, but my position is the one that I have just set out for you.  President Trump. I might add that we have many plants and factories coming back into the United States. Many jobs are coming back to Michigan, to Ohio, to Pennsylvania, to a lot of places where they were losing jobs. And we will have a different policy, but it's going to be a great policy for not only the United States, but a great policy worldwide, and I look very much forward to it.  Kevin Cirilli [Bloomberg].  Health Care Reform/Republican Party/Trade  Q. Yes, Mr. President, you have received—[inaudible]—health care. What exactly, sir, do you think would unify the Republican Party? And then, in terms of trade, what areas of common ground, do you think you will be able to have with the German Government?  And then, for Chancellor Merkel, what do you anticipate could be a concession you would be willing to give to the administration—[inaudible]—in negotiating trade?  President Trump. Well, Kevin, I think we have a very unified Republican Party. After all, we have the Presidency, we have the House, we have the Senate. And we're getting along very well, I will tell you. And if you were at the meeting that I just attended where we took 12 ""noes"" or semi-""noes,"" no ""yeses,"" and within a short period of time, everybody was very much on board, and a commitment to vote ""yes"".  I think we have a very unified party. I think we're actually more unified than even the election. You see—when they talk about me, I seem to be very popular, at least this week, within the party, because we have our highest numbers—the highest numbers that I've ever had in the party. So I think there's a great unification.  Now, health care is a very, very difficult subject; it's a very complex subject. And it's a subject that goes both ways. You do something for one side, and the other side doesn't like it. But it's really something that's come together very well, and I think it's going to be very, very popular, extremely popular.  On trade with Germany, I think we're going to do fantastically well. Right now I would say that the negotiators for Germany have done a far better job than the negotiators for the United States. But hopefully, we can even it out. We don't want victory; we want fairness. All I want is fairness.  Germany has done very well in its trade deals with the United States, and I give them credit for it, but—and I can speak to many other countries. I mean, you look at China; you look at virtually any country that we do business with. It's not exactly what you call good for our workers.  I mean, you look at the horrible NAFTA transaction; NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States. It's been a disaster for companies, and in particular, it's been a disaster for the workers. A lot of the companies just moved, but the workers are screwed. And it's probably the reason I'm standing here, maybe number one; that and maybe the military, building up our military, which we will do, and we will be stronger than ever before and, hopefully, not have to use it. But we will be stronger, and perhaps far stronger than ever before. But it's probably the reason I'm here, is when you talk about trade.  So I think that we are going to be a very different country. I think we're going to be—we're going to have great values. But in terms of our military, it's going to be much stronger. And our trade deals are going to be good, solid deals. Not deals that lead to closing plants and tremendous unemployment.  Okay? Thank you. Yes, ma'am.  Chancellor Merkel. When we speak about trade agreements, then the European Union is negotiating those agreements for all of the member states of the European Union, but obviously, there's also input by the member states; they bring to the table what's important to them.  We have underlined as a German industry, German business community, and have made the experience that any kind of agreement that we have concluded—for example, at the very latest with South Korea—brought us more jobs, actually. People were very much concerned about losing jobs—for example, the automotive industry—but in the end, it turned out—particularly as it regards South Korea—in the end it turned out that both sides benefited.  And I think it's only fair. That's the purpose of concluding agreements: that both sides win. And that is the sort of spirit, I think, in which we ought to be guided in negotiating any agreement between the United States of America and the EU. I hope that we can resume the agreement that we started. We have just now concluded our agreement with Canada, and I hope that we will come back to the table and talk about the agreement between EU and the U.S. again.  Mr. Graff, please.  Twitter/Wiretapping Q. [Inaudible]—Graff from Die Welt. Madam Chancellor, a question addressed to you. Today we're talking about trade. The President, in the past, always said that he doesn't like multilateral trade agreements, but he does bilateral trade agreements. Do you think from the EU's point of view, T-TIP is a bilateral agreement with Washington on one side, the EU the other side? Now, is the problem maybe that America, the President of the United States, and the Europeans have a basically different understanding of what the EU is all about? That's my question addressed to you.  And Mr. President, my question addressed to you, if I may——  [At this point, the reporter asked a question in English, as follows.]  ——rejected White House claims, is that the alleged wiretapping on you, on the Trump Tower, on Trump Organization, or on members of your campaign was—that British intelligence was either responsible for it or involved in it? After these claims are rejected, what is your take on that? Are there other suspects, or do you think it was a mistake to blame British intelligence for this?  And by the way, my second question, are there, from time to time, tweets that you regret in hindsight——  President Trump. Very seldom.  Q. Very seldom. And you have—so you never would have wished not to have tweeted something?  President Trump. Very seldom. Probably wouldn't be here right now—but very seldom. We have a tremendous group of people that listen, and I can get around the media when the media doesn't tell the truth, so I like that.  As far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common perhaps. [Laughter] And just to finish your question, we said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn't make an opinion on it. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox. And so you shouldn't be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox, okay?  Q. Okay, thank you.  Chancellor Merkel. Well, I believe that the President has clearly set out his philosophy as to what trade agreements have to bring about for the American side as well. I personally don't think that Germany needs to negotiate and not the European Union. We've devolved our competences to the European Union, so the European Union, or rather the Commission negotiates on behalf of the member states, so that's not going to prevent us from concluding agreements. For me, indeed, this would be then qualified as a bilateral agreement between the EU and the United States if we had it.  But the question is, will it be of benefit to both countries or not, and let me be very honest, very candid: A free trade agreement with the United States of America has not always been all that popular in Germany either. There have been less demonstrations against this free trade agreements in the United States than in Europe and also in Germany. So I am very glad to note that apparently the, sort of, perspective on that has changed a little bit at least in Germany, too.  President Trump. Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With King Abdullah II of Jordan,2017-04-05,"It's really an honor to welcome you here today. But before we begin, let me say a few words about recent events.  Chemical Weapons Attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria  Yesterday chemical attack—a chemical attack that was so horrific, in Syria, against innocent people, including women, small children, and even beautiful little babies. Their deaths was an affront to humanity. These heinous actions by the Asad regime cannot be tolerated. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this horrific attack and all other horrific attacks, for that matter.  Jordan-U.S. Relations  Your Majesty, Jordanians are known for their legendary hospitality, and we will do our very best to be equally gracious hosts. They're also known, however—I have to say this—for their fighting ability. And you are a great warrior, and we appreciate it. Thank you.  The historical ties and close friendship between our two countries dates back three-quarters of a century. In that time, the Middle East has faced many periods of crisis and unrest, perhaps never like it is today, however. Through them all, America has looked to Jordan as a valued partner, an advocate for the values of civilization, and a source of stability and hope.  I am deeply committed to preserving our strong relationship—which I will—and to strengthening America's longstanding support for Jordan. And you do have tremendous support within our country, I can tell you that.  As we know, the Middle East—and the entire world—is faced with one of its gravest threats in many, many years. Since the earliest days of the campaign against ISIS, Jordan has been a staunch ally and partner, and we thank you for that. Jordanian servicemembers have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilization, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage. So many have been lost, and we pay homage. So many.  In King Abdullah, America is blessed with a thoughtful and determined partner. He is a man who has spent years commanding his country's special forces. He really knows what being a soldier is, that I can tell you. And he knows how to fight. The King has been a leader in calling for a plan to defeat ISIS once and for all. And I'm with you on that. We're both leaders on that, believe me. That's what we speak about today, and that is what we are going to do. And it will be a shorter fight than a lot of people are thinking about, believe me. We've made tremendous strides, as we discussed. As you know, we had a very, very fine delegation come over from Egypt and also from Iraq, and they said more has been done in the last 6 weeks than has been done in years with the previous administration. And believe me, we're going to keep it that way.  We will destroy ISIS, and we will protect civilization. We have no choice. We will protect civilization. King Abdullah and I also discussed measures to combat the evil and ideology that inspires ISIS and plagues our planet. In addition, we also acknowledged the vital role that Jordan has played in hosting refugees from the conflict in Syria. We have just announced that the United States will contribute additional funds to Jordan for humanitarian assistance. This aid will help countries like Jordan host refugees until it is safe for them to return home. The refugees want to return home. I know that from so many other instances. They want to return back to their home. And that's a goal of any responsible refugee policy.  Finally, as we discussed, to advance the cause of peace in the Middle East, including peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. And I'm working very, very hard on trying to finally create peace between the Palestinians and Israel, and I think we'll be successful. I hope to be successful, I can tell you that.  The King has been an entire—a really tireless advocate for a solution, and he's going to help me with that and help me at the highest level. And we will be consulting with him very closely in the days ahead.  King Abdullah, I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your partnership. Working together, the United States and Jordan can help bring peace and stability to the Middle East and, in fact, the entire world. And we will do that.  Thank you very, very much for being with us. Thank you. Thank you.  King Abdullah. Mr. President, thank you for such a kind and warm welcome to the White House. I fondly remember the meetings we've had many years ago and, more recently, several months ago. You've always been a generous host and have always looked after us. We are very delighted with the way the discussions have gone so far, and we're delighted to be here in such a wonderful setting on such a beautiful day, which I think is a tremendous mark of how we are going to move into the future.  We've had a very good round of talks today, and I'm looking forward to continuing these discussions later on in our meetings after the press conference. What I do want to say is how much we deeply appreciate the close relations we have with United States, with you, Mr. President, and with the American people. This is a strategic partnership that we call and keep very close to our hearts, and it is a partnership on so many levels that we will continue, I think, with the frank discussions that we had today to improve on as we face the challenges of the future. And I am very delighted for your vision, your holistic approach to all the challenges in our region, and to the dedication of your team in being able to translate your policies into actions, successfully, hopefully, as we move forward.  The challenges we face today are many and are not exclusive to my region, as I've just mentioned. They are global, and particularly the threats to global security. Terrorism has no borders, no nationality, no religion, and therefore, joint action with a holistic approach, as I had just mentioned, Mr. President, is crucial. I am very delighted that you have the vision to be able to move in that direction, and I think that the world will be in a very good place as we move with all these challenges ahead.  No doubt, with all the challenges that we face in the world, the role of the U.S. is key to all the issues that we have around the world, but it's not just the fact that we should expect United States to do all the heavy lifting. The heavy lifting has to be done by all of us in the international community to support the United States in being able to translate that vision into the right direction. So there's a lot of responsibility for all of us in the international community to support the President, the administration, and the American people to bring brighter days to all of us.  We are very encouraged with the President's determination to support Arab and Muslim states in their fight against terrorism. But it is not only the fight of terrorism inside of our societies, but we, as Arab-Muslim states, standing behind the international community in being able to defeat this international scourge.  In Syria, we need a political solution that ends the conflict in the country and preserve its unity and territorial integrity.  As the President mentioned, the issue we discussed was the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is essentially the core conflict in our region. And the President's early engagement is beginning in bringing the Palestinians and Israelis together has been a very encouraging sign for all of us. And I think, sir, it was that initiative that allowed us at the Arab Summit last week to extend through the Arab Peace Initiative the message of peace to Israel, which we all, hopefully, will work together to make that come about.  All Arab countries relaunched the Arab Peace Initiative, as I said, last week. It offers a historic reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians, as well as all member states of the Arab League. It is the most comprehensive framework for lasting peace, and it ensures statehood for the Palestinians, but also security, acceptance, and normal ties for Israel with all Arab countries and, hopefully, all Islamic countries.  So we appreciate your commitment in all these issues, where others have failed. You will find a strong ally in Jordan in supporting you in all your policies. And if I may just say, as you have, on Syria and the gas attack, unfortunately, as you and I both agree, this is another testament to the failure of the international diplomacy to find the solutions to this crisis. But I believe under your leadership we will be able to unravel this very complicated situation.  This has been going on—ongoing for 7 years now, has descended into proxy wars from different parties with dubious agendas. But at the end of the day, as you pointed out, Mr. President, it's the civilians—women and children—that are paying the heaviest price. This is happening on our watch, on our conscience, as well as the global community. And I know the passion and the emotion that the President has expressed and how this should not be tolerated whatsoever. And this stressful—sorry, this threshold of inhumanity and savagery that are being crossed every day is something that I know the President will not allow to happen, wherever it may be. And I fully support and endorse the President in this issue.  So I want to thank you, sir, because you have the outlook of looking not just at the Syrian challenges, but that of Iraq, Israel, Palestine, Libya, and everything that is in our region. So I think your message to all of us is a message of hope, and that's what I take away from this conference.  President Trump. Thank you very much.  King Abdullah. And I thank you for all that you have done so far and all that you will do, sir. President Trump. All right. We'll take a few questions. Julie Pace [Associated Press].  Chemical Weapons Attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria/North Korea  Q. Thank you, sir. I have questions on Syria for both leaders. But if I could start with you, Mr. President. You've condemned the chemical attacks in Syria, but you also appeared in your statement yesterday to pin some of the blame on the Obama administration. You are the President now. Do you feel like you bear responsibility for responding to the chemical attacks? And does the chemical attack cross a red line for you?  President Trump. Well, I think the Obama administration had a great opportunity to solve this crisis a long time ago when he said the red line in the sand. And when he didn't cross that line after making the threat, I think that set us back a long ways, not only in Syria, but in many other parts of the world, because it was a blank threat. I think it was something that was not one of our better days as a country.  So I do feel that, Julie. I feel it very strongly.  Q. So you feel like you now have the responsibility to respond to the chemical attack?  President Trump. I now have responsibility, and I will have that responsibility and carry it very proudly, I will tell you that. It is now my responsibility. It was a great opportunity missed. As you know, I'll be meeting with the President of China very soon, in Florida. And that's another responsibility we have, and that's called the country of North Korea. We have a big problem. We have somebody that is not doing the right thing. And that's going to be my responsibility. But I'll tell you, that responsibility could have made—been made a lot easier if it was handled years ago.  Q. Before I move on to the King, could I just quickly ask you if the chemical attack crosses a red line for you?  President Trump. It crossed a lot of lines for me. When you kill innocent children, innocent babies—babies, little babies—with a chemical gas that is so lethal—people were shocked to hear what gas it was—that crosses many, many lines, beyond a red line. Many, many lines.  Thank you very much.  Q. And, Your Majesty, if I could ask about refugees. Your country has really borne the brunt of the refugee crisis in Syria. The President has signed travel bans that would block Syrians from coming to the U.S. If that goes into effect, what would the impact on your country and across the region be?  King Abdullah. Well, I think as the President pointed out, most, if not all, Syrian refugees actually want to go back to Syria. And that what we're working with the United States and the international community is to be able to stabilize the refugees in our country, give them the tools so that, as we're working with the solutions in Syria, we have the ability to be able to send them back as a positive influence into their economies.  And again, the President and the Europeans are being very forward-leaning in being able look after our host community—tremendous burden on our country, but again, tremendous appreciation to the United States and the Western countries for being able to help us in dealing with that.  Tarik, please. Q. Your Majesty, how does the outcome of the recent Arab Summit help the U.S. in its policy to advance Palestinian-Israeli negotiations?  King Abdullah. Well, as I said, the Arab Peace Initiative came out with a resounding resolution to offer peace to the Israelis, to make them feel that they're accepted into the neighborhood, and to be able to support the President as he brings both parties together.  And again, I have to remind people that very early on there was an early engagement by the President and his team to the Israelis and the Palestinians to be able to see what he can do to bring them together. It is the core conflict for a lot of us in the region. The President knows this. He has his instincts in the right place. And working with his team, our job, as I said, is to do the heavy lifting. The Arabs are prepared to do whatever they can to bring Israelis and Palestinians together under the leadership of the President.  President Trump. Thank you. John Yang [PBS NewsHour].  Syria/The President's Views on the Use of Military Force  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to follow up on Julie's question and press you a little more on Syria. You—how will you distinguish your policy and your actions on Syria from the inaction that you criticized of the previous administration? You say it's now your responsibility. What should we see or what should we look for that will be different?  And, Your Majesty, I'd like to ask you, what gives you—this is now your second meeting with the President—what gives you the optimism that Mr. Trump will succeed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where so many and others have failed before him to be a broker for peace?  President Trump. I like to think of myself as a very flexible person. I don't have to have one specific way, and if the world changes, I go the same way, I don't change. Well, I do change, and I am flexible, and I'm proud of that flexibility. And I will tell you, that attack on children yesterday had a big impact on me—big impact. That was a horrible, horrible thing. And I've been watching it and seeing it, and it doesn't get any worse than that.  And I have that flexibility, and it's very, very possible—and I will tell you, it's already happened—that my attitude toward Syria and Asad has changed very much. And if you look back over the last few weeks, there were other attacks using gas. You're now talking about a whole different level.  So, as you know, I would love to have never been in the Middle East. I would love to have never seen that whole big situation start. But once it started, we got out the wrong way, and ISIS formed in the vacuum, and lots of bad things happened. I will tell you, what happened yesterday is unacceptable to me.  Q. Can I follow up, sir? You, yesterday—last year, you seemed to be reluctant to get involved or to intervene in Syria directly. Is that one thing that's changed after yesterday?  President Trump. Well, one of the things I think you've noticed about me is, militarily, I don't like to say where I'm going and what I'm doing. And I watched past administrations say, we will attack at such and such a day at such and such an hour. And you, being a warrior—you would say, why are they saying that? And I'm sure you sat back in Jordan, and you said, why are they saying that?  I watched Mosul, where the past administration was saying, we will be attacking in 4 months. And I said, why are they doing that? Then, a month goes by, and they say, we will be attacking in 3 months, and then 2 months, and then we will be attacking next week. And I'm  saying, why are they doing that? And as you know, Mosul turned out to be a much harder fight than anyone thought, and a lot of people have been lost in that fight.  I'm not saying I'm doing anything one way or the other, but I'm certainly not going to be telling you, as much as I respect you, John. [Laughter] Thank you.  King Abdullah. Sir, I think, on behalf of the President, what I saw was an early engagement by the President and his team, with all of us in the region, about the challenges between the Israelis and Palestinians. I had the honor of seeing the President and his team again in January where this was discussed. The President understands the nuances and the challenges. I think he has the courage and the dedication to be able to do this. Like I said before, all of us have a responsibility to help the President push us over the finish line.  And so, his team has been in the region, they've been talking to all the partners, and it is our job to facilitate the atmospherics between Israelis and Palestinians to move together, and give the support to the President to be able to smooth the edges over between Israelis and Palestinians to achieve this. And the President understands that if we don't solve this problem, how are we going to win the global fight against terrorism, which is his number-one priority? So this is a core issue that he understands, and I think he has the commitment, and he has my full support for this, as he does from many, many countries in our region.  President Trump. And I have to just say that the world is a mess. I inherited a mess. Whether it's the Middle East, whether it's North Korea, whether it's so many other things, whether it's in our country—horrible trade deals—I inherited a mess. We're going to fix it. We're going to fix it.  Okay.  King Abdullah. Thank you. Nadiya.  Iran/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization/Syria  Q. Thank you, Your Majesty. You touched upon the subject now, but if I ask you to look forward, how do you see the future of fighting terrorism post-Raqqa and Mosul, especially the role that Jordan will play in the eastern part of Iraq? And do you believe the real battle will start then?  And if I may, Mr. President, you know very well that the Iranian militias and Hizballah has been propping the Syrian regime for a while, over a few years now. Will you go after them? What message will you give them today? And will you work with the Russians to stop—to ground the Syrian air force and to establish safe zones? Thank you.  King Abdullah. Well, the first part is that we are seeing, very recently, tremendous gains on the ground in Raqqa and Mosul. Again, I think, as the President alluded to, it's very difficult to put timelines on this issue because the battle space is always very fluid. But I think that the war is being won on the ground.  Having said that, terrorists are on the move. They'll be on the move inside of Iraq and inside of Syria, so that we have to make sure that we adapt our plans accordingly. And they move beyond borders, beyond our region and elsewhere. So as we and the administration have discussed, it's this holistic approach: How do we fight them wherever they are? And I think that is the understanding.  Terrorists have no respect for borders and religions and people. So it's the seriousness of how we do this holistic approach that I've mentioned several times. And what I am really delighted is that the understanding by the President and the administration in how to deal with this globally.  And I think you're seeing a move in the right direction because the policy now is being charted out, and my discussions with the Defense Secretary and the Foreign Secretary allows us to be then able to decide how we adapt ourselves in the region to be able to come in line with international diplomacy.  President Trump. The Iran deal made by the previous administration is one of the worst deals I have ever witnessed, and I've witnessed some beauties. It's one of the worst deals I've ever witnessed. It should never have been made. It was totally one-sided against the United States and, frankly, against much of the Middle East.  I will do whatever I have to do. They have a deal. It was, some people say, not done properly even in the form of its finalization. There was no vote from Congress. There was no real ratification. But I will do what I have to do with respect to the Iran deal.  As far as ISIS is concerned, the United States will work with whoever it's appropriate to work with to totally eradicate ISIS and other terrorists. And by the way, ISIS is one group, but others have formed. Frankly, they're all over the place. We will do what we have to do to eradicate terrorism.  Q. But, sir, I'm talking about the Iranian militias in Syria supporting the Syrian regime separate of the nuclear deal.  President Trump. Yes.  Q. What message do you have for them today?  President Trump. You will see. They will have a message. You will see what the message will be. Okay? Thank you.  Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,2017-04-12,"I also want to acknowledge the great work being done by our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to strengthen the NATO alliance, as well as the Secretary's trip to Moscow to promote the security interest of the United States and its allies. He did a terrific job—just watched parts of it—did an absolutely terrific job.  Sixty-eight years ago this month, not far from where we are gathered today, President Harry Truman spoke at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. In the nearly seven decades since Harry Truman spoke those words, the NATO alliance has been the bulwark of international peace and security.  NATO allies defeated communism and liberated the captive nations of the cold war. They secured the longest period of unbroken peace that Europe has ever known. This enduring partnership is rooted out of so many different things, but our common security is always number one, and our common devotion to human dignity and freedom.  Since 1949, the NATO member states have more than doubled, increasing from 12 to 28. On Monday, I signed the protocol to approve the 29th, the country of Montenegro. In the coming months and years, I'll work closely with all of our NATO allies to enhance this partnership and to adapt to the challenges of the future, of which there will be many. This includes upgrading NATO to focus on today's most pressing security and all of its challenges, including migration and terrorism.  We must also work together to resolve the disaster currently taking place in Syria. We are grateful for the support of NATO members and partners in their condemnation of Asad's murderous attack, using the most horrible weapons. The vicious slaughter of innocent civilians with chemical weapons, including the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies, must be forcefully rejected by any nation that values human life. It is time to end this brutal civil war, defeat terrorists, and allow refugees to return home.  In facing our common challenges, we must also ensure that NATO members meet their financial obligations and pay what they owe. Many have not been doing that. The Secretary General and I agree that other member nations must satisfy their responsibility to contribute 2 percent of GDP to defense. If other countries pay their fair share, instead of relying on the United States to make up the difference, we will all be much more secure and our partnership will be made that much stronger.  The Secretary General and I had a productive discussion about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism. I complained about that a long time ago and they made a change, and now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete; it's no longer obsolete. It's my hope that NATO will take on an increased role in supporting our Iraqi partners in their battle against ISIS. I'm also sending General McMaster to Afghanistan to find out how we can make progress alongside our Afghan partners and NATO allies. Every generation has strived to adapt the NATO alliance to meet the challenges of their times, and on my visit to Brussels this spring, which I look very much forward to, we will work together to do the same. We must not be trapped by the tired thinking that so many have, but apply new solutions to face new circumstances. And that's all throughout the world. We're not here to stand on ceremony, but to develop real strategies to achieve safety, security, and peace. We're here to protect the freedom and prosperity of our citizens and to give them the future they so richly deserve.  Secretary General, I'm honored to have you here today and to reaffirm our commitment to this alliance and to the enduring values that we proudly—and I mean, very proudly—share. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. Thank you.  Secretary General Stoltenberg. Thank you, sir. Thank you so much, sir, Mr. President.  We just had an excellent and very productive meeting, and it's really an honor to meet you for the first time here in the White House.  We agree that NATO is a bedrock of security, both for Europe and for the United States. Two world wars and a cold war have taught us all that peace in Europe is not only important for Europeans, but is also important for the prosperity and the security of North America. So a strong NATO is good for Europe, but a strong NATO is also good for the United States.  And therefore, I welcome the very strong commitment of the United States to the security of Europe. We see this commitment not only in words, but also in deeds. Over the past months, thousands of U.S. troops have been deploying to Europe, a clear demonstration that America stands with allies to protect peace and defend our freedom. And yesterday you announced the completion of the ratification of Montenegro's membership in NATO, another expression of your strong commitment to Europe and to the transatlantic bond. And we thank you for that.  In a more dangerous and more unpredictable world, it is important to have friends and allies. And in NATO, America has the best friends and the best allies in the world. Together, we represent half of the world's economic and military power. No other superpower has ever had such a strategic advantage. This makes the United States stronger and safer.  We saw that after the 9/11 attacks on the United States. That was the first time NATO invoked our article 5, the collective defense clause. Allies sent AWACS surveillance planes to help patrol American skies, and we launched NATO's biggest military operation ever in Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands of Europeans and Canadian soldiers have served shoulder-to-shoulder with American troops. More than a thousand have paid the ultimate price.  Earlier today I laid a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery in tribute to the fallen. It was a deeply moving experience. We owe it to our service men and women to preserve the hard-earned gains we have made together in Afghanistan. We were reminded of their sacrifice just this week when a U.S. soldier was killed there fighting ISIL. Our mission in Afghanistan is a major contribution to the fight against international terrorism.  NATO plays a key role in many other ways also. All NATO allies are part of the global coalition to counter ISIL, and NATO provides direct support to the coalition with training for Iraqi forces in their fight against terrorists and more intelligence sharing. And you are right: We have established a new division for intelligence, which enhances our ability to fight terrorism and working together in the alliance to fight terrorism in an even more effective way. But we agreed today, you and I, that NATO can, and must, do more in the global fight against terrorism. In the fight against terrorism, training local forces is one of the best weapons we have. NATO has the experience, the expertise, and the staying power to make a real difference, and fighting terrorism will be an important topic when NATO leaders meet in Brussels in May.  The other major topic will be fairer burden sharing in our alliance. And we had a total discussion on this issue today. And, Mr. President, I thank you for your attention to this issue. We are already seeing the effect of your strong focus on the importance of burden sharing in the alliance. We agree that allies need to redouble their efforts to meet the pledge we all made in 2014 to invest more in our alliance.  It is about spending more on defense. It is about delivering the capabilities we need. And it is about contributing forces to NATO missions and operations. This means cash, capabilities, and contributions.  Fair burden sharing has been my top priority since taking office. We have now turned a corner. In 2016, for the first time in many years, we saw an increase in defense spending across European allies and Canada, a real increase of 3.8 percent or $10 billion more for our defense. We are now working to keep up the momentum, including by developing national plans outlining how to make good on what we agreed in 2014. We know that we all need to contribute our fair share because we need to keep our nations safe in a more dangerous world.  We discussed many different topics during our meeting today, including the horrendous use of chemical weapons in Syria. Any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable, cannot go unanswered, and those responsible must be held accountable.  So, Mr. President, thank you once again. I look forward to working with you to keeping the alliance strong, and I look forward to welcoming you to Brussels in May when heads of state and government in the alliance meet there to address the challenges and the need to continue to adapt the alliance to a more challenging security environment and to respond both to the need for fairer burden sharing and stepping up our efforts to fight international terrorism. So thank you, once again.  The President. Thank you very much. Great. Thank you.  So we'll have a couple of questions.  Jeff Mason [Reuters].  Russia-U.S. Relations/China-U.S. Relations  Q. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about two topics, if I may. First, has your view of Vladimir Putin changed after what's happened in Syria? And what are you prepared—what is the United States prepared to do if he continues to support Asad?  And on a separate question, have you made a deal after your chat last night with the President of China, about China helping to reign in North Korea? And is that one reason you've decided not to label Beijing a currency manipulator? For the——  The President. Well, I'll be speaking to—do you want to go ahead? Go ahead.  Q. May I? For the Secretary General, do you believe NATO should continue to bolster its presence along the alliance's eastern border? And do you have—are you confident that you have President Trump and the United States' support for that? Thank you. The President. I'll be speaking with Rex Tillerson in a little while—he's calling in. I think he had a very successful meeting in Russia. We'll see. We'll see the end result, which will be in a long period of time, perhaps. But the end result is what's most important, not just talk. And I think that, based on everything I'm hearing, things went pretty well, maybe better than anticipated.  It would be wonderful, as we were discussing just a little while ago, if NATO and our country could get along with Russia. Right now we're not getting along with Russia at all. We may be at an all-time low in terms of a relationship with Russia. This has built for a long period of time. But we're going to see what happens. Putin is the leader of Russia. Russia is a strong country. We're a very, very strong country. We're going to see how that all works out.  Last night, separately, I spoke with a man that I've gotten to know. I don't know Putin, but I do know this gentleman; I've spent a lot of time with him over the last 2 days, and he is the President of China. You were there—most of you were there—and it was quite an interesting period of time.  President Xi wants to do the right thing. We had a very good bonding. I think we had a very good chemistry together. I think he wants to help us with North Korea. We talked trade. We talked a lot of things. And I said, the way you're going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea; otherwise, we're just going to go it alone. That will be all right too. But going it alone means going it with lots of other nations.  But I was very impressed with President Xi, and I think he means well and I think he wants to help. We'll see whether or not he does.  Q. Do you feel like you have a deal with him? And if I could just——  The President. Excuse me?  Q. Do you feel like you have a deal with him in terms of the currency manipulation designation? And have your views changed on Putin?  The President. Well, we'll see. We're going to see, we're going to see about that. And I'll also see about Putin over a period of time. It would be a fantastic thing if we got along with Putin and if we got along with Russia. And that could happen, and it may not happen; it may be just the opposite.  I can only tell you what I would like to do. I would love to be able to get along with everybody. Right now the world is a mess. But I think by the time we finish, I think it's going to be a lot better place to live. And I can tell you that, speaking for myself, by the time I'm finished, it's going to be a lot better place to live in, because right now it's nasty.  Secretary General Stoltenberg. NATO is in the process of implementing the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the cold war. And one element of that is to increase our military presence in the eastern part of the alliance. And we are now deploying four battle groups to the three Baltic countries and Poland, and there have also been more U.S. forces in that part of Europe.  And this is the first time in many, many years that we see an increase in the military presence of the United States in Europe. So we are increasing our presence, and we're also increasing the readiness and the preparedness of our forces so we can quickly reinforce if needed. We consider the presence we will have when the four battle groups are in place as sufficient given the current security situation in Europe. But of course, we will assess the situation and follow the developments very closely.  The message from NATO is that what we do is proportionate; it is defensive. And we don't want a new cold war. We don't want a new arms race. And actually, we strongly believe that there is no contradiction between a strong NATO, a credible deterrence on defense, and political dialogue with Russia. Actually, we believe that a precondition for the political dialogue with Russia is that we are strong and that we are united. But based on that, we can talk to Russia, because Russia is our neighbor, Russia is here to stay, so we have to find ways to manage our relationship with Russia.  And I am absolutely certain that the United States supports this approach, partly because the United States is contributing with forces to our enhanced presence in the eastern part of the alliance and also in the southeast of the alliance in Romania, and the United States and the President has clearly expressed that they want dialogue with Russia, but based on unity and strength in the alliance.  Then, the next question is from Jon Sopel [BBC].  Chemical Weapons Attack in Syria/Russia  Q. And thank you very much. Secretary General, how long do you think it will take you to persuade the other European countries to burden share? And what are you going to do to persuade them?  Mr. President, could I ask you——  President Trump. I like that question. [Laughter]  Q. I'm here to help. [Laughter]  And, Mr. President, do you think it's conceivable, what's your instinct—was it possible that Syrian forces could have launched that attack in Idlib last week without the Russians knowing? And have you been disappointed, surprised by Vladimir Putin's reaction since then?  Thank you very much.  President Trump. I think it's certainly possible; I think it's probably unlikely. And I know they're doing investigations into that right now. I would like to think that they didn't know, but certainly, they could have. They were there. So we'll find out. General Mattis is looking into it with the entire Pentagon group that does that kind of work.  So I—it was very disappointing to see. It's disappointing no matter who does it, but when you get into the gases—especially that form—it's vicious and violent. And everybody in this room saw it all too many times over the last 3 or 4 days: young children dying, babies dying, fathers holding children in their arms that were dead. Dead children—there can't be a worse sight, and it shouldn't be allowed. That's a butcher. That's a butcher.  So I felt we had to do something about it. I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing, and it was very, very successfully done, as you well know. Thank you.  Secretary General Stoltenberg. On defense spending and burden sharing, that has been my top priority. I have raised it in all my meetings, in all capitals I have visited, with Prime Ministers, Presidents, Ministers of Finance, and of course, also Defense and Foreign Ministers. And I expect, of course, all allies to make good on what they decided back in 2014. And the very strong and clear message from President Trump has been very helpful. So now we see that things are starting to move in the right direction. For the first time after many, many years of decline in defense spending, we now see an increase in defense spending across Europe and Canada. So they have started to move in the right direction; 3.8 percent real increase in defense spending across Europe and Canada is a significant step in the right direction. It's not enough. We still have a long way to go, but at least they have turned a corner—the European allies have turned a corner. Instead of reducing defense spending, they have started to increase defense spending.  Then I think it is important to remember that this something the Europeans do because they know that this is in their own security interest. It is in their interest to invest more in Europe defense because the world has become more dangerous.  Many European allies, of course, reduced—or all European allies reduced defense spending after the end of the cold war because then tensions went down. But if you are decreasing defense spending when tensions are going down, then you have to be able to increase the defense spending when tensions are going up. And now they are going up.  So we have still a long way to go, but I'm encouraged by the fact that we have started to move in the right direction. And last year, there were five allies spending 2 percent. This year Romania has declared that they will reach 2 percent. Next year, Latvia and Lithuania will also reach 2 percent, so we go from five to eight—which is at least going in the right direction. But still we have some work to do.  President Trump. And I did ask about all the money that hasn't been paid over the years, will that money be coming back. We'll be talking about that, right? [Laughter] We want to talk about that too.  Anita Kumar, where are you? Hi. McClatchy. Hi.  China/United Nations Security Council Resolution on Syrian Chemical Weapons Attack  Q. Mr. President, what's your reaction to the U.N.'s vote condemning the chemical attack in Syria overall? And can you talk a little bit about your reaction to China abstaining? Were you aware that was going to happen? Did President Xi talk to you about that, give you a heads up? And how does that affect your relationship?  President Trump. We did talk last night. I think it's wonderful that they abstained. As you know, very few people expected that. And no, I was not surprised that China did abstain. Very, very few people thought that that was going to happen. So we're honored by the vote. That's the vote that should have taken place.  Q. Mr. Secretary General, you talked a little bit about Moscow, about Russia. How do you counter the impression in general—they've been interfering in recent democratic elections. How do you counter Moscow's power?  Secretary General Stoltenberg. The most important thing is to have a strong alliance, to stay united, and be firm and predictable in our approach to Russia. And that means that we have to invest in our collective defense. That's exactly what we are doing. Deploy more troops in the eastern part of the alliance, increase the readiness of our forces, and increase defense spending. And I welcome the very strong message from President Trump on the importance of increased defense spending. We have started to do this, so we are implementing the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the cold war, providing credible deterrence. But at the same time, we have to find ways to engage with Russia, to talk with Russia. Because Russia is not—will not go away; Russia will be our biggest neighbor, and we have to find ways to live with them and to try to avoid a new cold war, a new arms race.  And that's exactly why I am very much in favor of what we call the dual-track approach to Russia. And as a former Norwegian politician, I have the experience to work with the Russians, because Norway is bordering Russia. And Norway was able, even during the cold war, to develop, I would call it, a pragmatic working relationship with Russia, cooperating with them on energy, on border issues, on environment, on fishery, and also in military affairs. And that was not despite our membership in NATO, but it was because of our membership in NATO. Because NATO provided the strength, the predictability, the platform for a small country to have a political dialogue with Russia.  So I strongly believe that the only way to deter Russia is to be strong. But the only way to avoid a new cold war, avoid a new arms race, and avoid increasing tensions is to continue to engage Russia in a political dialogue, and to make sure that what we do is defensive and proportionate in response to a more assertive Russia.  President Trump. Okay.  Secretary General Stoltenberg. Then, I give the floor to—[inaudible].  Europe-Russia Relations/Global Instability/North Korea  Q. Thank you. Mr. President, I'm from Norway. Russia is our neighboring country. What do you think Europe has to fear from Russia if this tension continues?  President Trump. Say it——  Q. What do you think that European countries have to fear from Russia if this tension continues?  President Trump. I cannot hear. I cannot understand——  Secretary General Stoltenberg. She asked——  Q. What—I'll do it again. What do you think European countries have to fear from Russia if this tension continues to escalate?  And for you, Mr. Secretary General, the President has said that the attack in Syria last week was warranted and was also an attack on U.S. allies. Do you think that this attack was warranted? And do you see NATO playing any supporting role in future actions in Syria?  President Trump. Well, I want to just start by saying, hopefully, they're going to have to fear nothing, ultimately. Right now there is a fear, and there are problems—there are certainly problems. But ultimately, I hope that there won't be a fear and there won't be problems and the world can get along. That would be the ideal situation.  It's crazy what's going on—whether it's the Middle East or you look at—no matter where—the Ukraine—you look at—whatever you look at, it's got problems, so many problems. And ultimately, I believe that we are going to get rid of most of those problems, and there won't be fear of anybody. That's the way it should be. We have a very big problem in North Korea. And as I said, I really think that China is going to try very hard, and has already started. A lot of the coal boats have already been turned back—you saw that yesterday and today—they've been turned back. The vast amount of coal that comes out of North Korea going to China, they've turned back the boats. That's a big step, and they have many other steps that I know about.  So we'll see what happens. It may be effective, it may not be effective. If it's not effective, we will be effective, I can promise you that. Thank you.  Secretary General Stoltenberg. NATO has constantly condemned the use of chemical weapons in Syria. And the use of chemical weapons is horrendous, and it's a clear violation of international law. And any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and cannot go unanswered, so those responsible must be held accountable.  The strike against the airbase in Syria was a U.S. operation based on U.S. intelligence. But you have seen that within the alliance, this has been something which has been met with a lot of understanding because NATO allies do not accept that chemical weapons are used. And therefore, we also strongly support the efforts of the fact-finding commission to try to find out actually what happened and to make sure that we don't see any use of chemical weapons in the future.  President Trump. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni of Italy,2017-04-20,"It's wonderful to have you in our wonderful people's house, known as the White House. And so many great Italian friends are with us today. And we renew, always, the deep ties of history and friendship that link together the American and the Italian peoples. That history traces its roots to the timeless contributions of Italy to civilization and human progress—so true. Stretching all the way back to ancient Rome, through the ages, your country has been a beacon of artistic and scientific achievement—and that continues today—from Venice to Florence, from Verdi to Pavarotti, a friend of mine. Great friend of mine. These bonds of history and culture have only grown stronger as our two nations have become close partners, dear friends, and very vital allies.  Mr. Prime Minister, I'm thrilled that you are here today to discuss how we can make this great relationship even more productive in the years to come. On the economy, Italy is one of America's largest trading partners. A lot of people don't know that. We both seek a trading relationship that is balanced, reciprocal—I love the word ""reciprocal,"" because we don't have too many reciprocal trading partnerships, I will tell you that, but we will very soon—and fair, benefiting both of our countries. And we can work together to achieve that outcome, and that will happen.  Italy is also a key partner in the fight against terrorism. Italy is now the second largest contributor of troops to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. I would also like to thank you, Prime Minister, for your leadership on seeking stabilization in Libya and for your crucial efforts to deny ISIS a foothold in the Mediterranean. You fought hard. We're grateful for your role in the anti-ISIS campaign. All nations must condemn this barbaric enemy and support the effort to achieve its total and complete destruction.  Also, as you know, Mr. Prime Minister, we have more than 30,000 American servicemembers, families, and personnel who are stationed across your country. As we reaffirm our support for historic institutions, we must also reaffirm the requirement that everyone must pay their full and fair share for the cost of defense.  Together, we can address many pressing challenges, including two that greatly affect both of our countries, those of large-scale migration and international smuggling. Maintaining strong borders is a vital component of any security policy, and a responsible approach to refugees is one that seeks the eventual return of refugees to their home countries so that they can help to rebuild their own nations.  Finally, I want to say how much I look forward to visiting Sicily for the G-7, as we seek to foster cooperation not only on matters of security, but also science, commerce, health, and technology. Our two countries have shared interests and shared values, and we can each make great contributions to the other.  Mr. Prime Minister, I again want to thank you for being with us and being our true friend. Italy is a spectacular place; I know it well. I love the people of Italy. We have 18 million Italians living in the United States, people originally from Italy. And it's a great honor to have many of them as my friends. Thank you for being here.  Prime Minister Gentiloni. Thank you very much. Thank you for hosting us here. It's an honor to be here at the White House today. And I'll now switch to Italian.  [At this point, Prime Minister Gentiloni spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Prime Minister Gentiloni. We had a very fruitful meeting, which reflects an ancient friendship, as the President reminded us with his words. This friendship is also a sign of the 18 million Italian Americans who have such an important role in our country—in this country. And this friendship is witnessed also by the fact that Italy is the second choice for American students who study abroad, and we're very proud of this. And this confirms the importance that the United States gives to the cultural dimension of our country, as the President, himself, just said.  This friendship is based on a common commitment against terrorism. This commitment, see, is a commitment in which we are both very active—our country is very active in Iraq and in Afghanistan, and I think that the stabilization work will be decisive, the civilization work of Iraq, after the military defeat that we expect for Daesh.  We know that this action against terrorism must take place within our individual countries. In Europe, with the social and cultural commitment against radicalization, by cooperating with Islamic communities, Italy contributes to peace and to stability in the Mediterranean. In Syria, where I believe the U.S. choice to react to the use of chemical weapons by Bashar al-Asad, and where a negotiated solution is more necessary than ever. In Libya—and we discussed this in our meeting—where we need to work against the division of the country in order to stabilize it.  This is a very decisive task if we want to manage the migratory flows without giving up on our values and our humanitarian principles. And we need to contrast the horrible traffic of people and clandestine refugees.  Italy is convinced of its strategic commitment in favor of the transatlantic relationship. We have also spoken about common commitments in NATO and the goals that were identified in 2014 and the commitments on military expenses and the contribution that each country must make towards collective security. We are proud of our contribution.  And finally, Italy is a country of dialogue. We are proud because we succeeded in keeping open the doors in difficult crises. Dialogue can be useful, even vis-à-vis Russia, without obviously giving up our unity and our principles and without giving up our strength and our values.  I also told President Trump that we have confidence—even though this is a difficult moment, and we all know it's difficult right now—I have—we have confidence in the future of the European Union and certainly in the importance of the relationship between the U.S. and Italy. These are the two pillars that the transatlantic relationship is based on and a great part of peace and freedom in the world. We are going through a difficult time, but I have confidence that the European Union will continue to be a positive response to this.  And finally, we are expecting and I look forward to the President's visit to the summit in Taormina, and I trust that this will be the opportunity to show him the unity of our leaders and of the principal free economies of the planet. Because right now we really do need this unity. Once again, thank you, Mr. President.  President Trump. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Appreciate it.  I'll take a few questions. John Roberts of Fox, please.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization/Shooting in Paris, France/North Korea/China/Iran  Q. Mr. President, thanks so much. I hope you'll forgive me for asking you three-part questions; it's been a while. In just the last few minutes—I believe it was while you were meeting with the Prime Minister—there was a shooting in downtown Paris.  President Trump. I see that.  Q. It's being described as a potential terrorist attack. I wonder if you have something on that.  And further to that, to the big trouble spots that you're dealing with right now, North Korea and Iran. Do you believe that the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, is mentally unstable? Is that one of the reasons why you're so concerned about these latest developments? Is he a man who can be reasoned with? And on Iran, do you have reason to suspect that they are cheating on the JCPOA?  And to Mr. Prime Minister, you talked just a moment ago about your commitment to NATO. President Trump would like to see all NATO members contribute 2 percent of their GDP to NATO. Your contribution is slightly less than 1 percent. Will you commit to committing 2 percent of your GDP to the alliance going forward? Thank you.  President Trump. Well, first of all, I love the question you asked the Prime Minister. I look forward to his answer—[laughter]—because I'm going to be asking him that same question very soon.  Well, first of all, our condolences from our country to the people of France. Again, it's happening, it seems. I just saw it as I was walking in, so that's a terrible thing, and it's a very, very terrible thing that's going on in the world today. But it looks like another terrorist attack. And what can you say? It just never ends. We have to be strong, and we have to be vigilant. And I've been saying it for a long time.  As far as North Korea is concerned, we are in very good shape. And we're building our military rapidly. A lot of things have happened over the last short period of time. I've been here for approximately 91 days; we're doing a lot of work. We're in very good position. We're going to see what happens.  I can't ask your—answer your question on stability. I hope the answer is a positive one, not a negative one. But hopefully, that will be something that gets taken care of. I have great respect for the President of China. As you know, we had a great summit in Florida, and Palm Beach, and got to know each other and, I think, like each other. I can say from my standpoint I liked him very much. I respect him very much. And I think he's working very hard.  I can say that all of the pundits out there are saying they never have seen China work like they're working right now. Many coal ships have sent back. Many other things have happened. Some very unusual moves have been made over the last 2 or 3 hours. And I really have confidence that the President will try very hard. We don't know whether or not they're able to do that, but I have absolute confidence that he will be trying very, very hard. And one of the reasons that we're talking about trade deals and we're talking about all of the different things—but we're slowing up a little bit. I actually told him, I said, you'll make a much better deal on trade if you get rid of this menace or do something about the menace of North Korea. Because that's what it is, it's a menace right now.  So we'll see what happens. As far as Iran is concerned, I think they are doing a tremendous disservice to an agreement that was signed. It was a terrible agreement. It shouldn't have been signed. It shouldn't have been negotiated the way it was negotiated. I'm all for agreements, but that was a bad one, as bad as I've ever seen negotiated.  They are not living up to the spirit of the agreement, I can tell you that. And we're analyzing it very, very carefully, and we'll have something to say about it in the not-too-distant future. But Iran has not lived up to the spirit of the agreement. And they have to do that. They have to do that. So we will see what happens.  Thank you very much, John.  Prime Minister Gentiloni. Thank you, Mr. President.  [Prime Minister Gentiloni continued in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Prime Minister Gentiloni. First of all, allow me to join President Trump's words for what happened in Paris, these words of condolences and closeness to the French people. And this is a very delicate period for them, just 3 days before the election.  As far as the question is concerned, the commitment has been made. It was made during a NATO summit. And we are used to respecting our commitments. We know that this will be a gradual process; it has already begun. And we know that Italy has certain limitations when it comes to its budget, but despite these limitations, our commitment for common defense is very clear.  And as I said earlier, I'm very proud not only of the progress made by—in our financial commitment, but also proud of the contribution that we give to the security of the alliance in so many areas of the world. We talked about Iraq and Afghanistan, but we could also talk about the Baltic Sea or the Balkans. And in all of these areas, you will see the presence of Italian forces within the alliance, and we are proud of that.  Sky News.  [A reporter spoke in Italian, and her remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  European Union/Pope Francis  Q. Giovanna Pancheri, Sky Italia. First, for you, President [Prime Minister; White House correction.] Gentiloni, I wanted to ask you: We saw from this new administration a new type of policy on the international scene, very different from what we had in the past. And one of the last important operations, which was carried out by President Trump, was in Syria with a bombing following the use of chemical weapons by the Asad regime. I wanted to ask you, does Italy think or conceive a possibility to take action in—more action in Syria?  [The reporter continued in English as follows.] Q. ——since my colleague from Fox News did, so I'm going to take as well the possibility to ask you two questions. First of all, about European Union, you have said in the past the Brexit was a great thing, and that you think that other country will follow. So you know that Italy is an important player and supporter of European integration. Do you believe that actually a strong Europe is important from—for the United States, also looking forward at the French election?  And on the second question, is that you said that you're looking forward to come to Italy for the G-7, and I wanted to know if you're also looking forward, if it's going to be possible, to meet Pope Francis during your Italian trip. Thank you.  [Prime Minister Gentiloni spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Prime Minister Gentiloni. Syria: We immediately assessed the operation that was ordered by President Trump and decided that this was a motivated response to the use of chemical weapons. We added that it's up to everyone to consider negotiation as the road through which we, hopefully, can put an end to this infinite dramatic war and come to peace. Italy is not directly involved in the operations, in military operations in Syria other than marginal aspects, but it's not our plan to change this attitude.  President Trump. Yes, a strong Europe is very, very important to me as President of the United States. And it's also, in my opinion, in my very strong opinion, important for the United States. We want to see it. We will help it be strong, and it's very much to everybody's advantage. And I look very much forward to meeting the Pope.  Fabian of the Hill [Jordan Fabian, The Hill]. Fabian. Yes.  Health Care Reform Legislation  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Some people on Capitol Hill believe you can get one of two things next week: a vote on health care or a vote on a Government funding bill. So my question is, which one is more important to you have: a vote on health care or a vote on a bill to keep the Government open?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, I want to get your thoughts on a referendum in Turkey that occurred last week. You spoke about democratic values in the European continent, so are you concerned with the result of the Turkish referendum? And is that something that you discussed with President Trump?  President Trump. Okay, I want to get both. [Laughter] Are you shocked to hear that? And we're doing very well on health care. We'll see what happens. But this is a great bill. There's a great plan. And this will be great health care. It's evolving. You know, there was never a give-up. The press sort of reported there was, like, a give-up. There's no give-up. We started. Remember, it took Obamacare 17 months. I've really been negotiating this for 2 months, maybe even less than that, because we had a 30-day period where we did lots of other things the first 30 days.  But this has really been 2 months. And this is a continuation. And the plan gets better and better and better. And it's gotten really, really good. And a lot of people are liking it a lot. We have a good chance of getting it soon. I'd like to say next week, but it will be—I believe we will get it. And whether it's next week or shortly thereafter. As far as keeping the Government open, I think we want to keep the Government open. Don't you agree? So, yes, I think we'll get both. Thank you.  [Prime Minister Gentiloni spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Prime Minister Gentiloni. The Turkish referendum is a fact that we must take note of, leaving aside any debates that can take place about how the vote took place. But I believe that the European leadership have taken note of the vote. The consequences will depend a great deal on how the Turkish Government and President Erdogan, especially, will take into account almost half of the population's expression of a different opinion. Will there be an inclusive approach, or will there be a confrontation in this part of Turkey? This will be very important for us and the European Union.  The other thing that's going to be very important is to—is the respect of the certain fundamental principles. We are members of the Atlantic alliance—Italy and Turkey—and Italy contributes to Turkey's defense with its own military assets. We believe that, among our countries, there should be a cooperation, and hopefully—and we trust—that this cooperation will have, among its consequences, the solution of the case concerning the journalist—blogger who's been detained over the last few days in Turkey.  [Inaudible]—Italian Radio.  [A reporter spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Libya/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Terrorist Organization  Q. Ruffalo—[inaudible]. President Gentiloni, you have focused a lot on the leadership—Italian leadership and American leadership—in order to stabilize Libya. What do you expect exactly from Washington? And especially, I am asking you, what is necessary in this process, in this relationship of cooperation with Russia?  [The reporter continued in English as follows.]  Q. President Trump, do you see a role for your administration in helping stabilizing Libya? And do you agree that stabilizing Libya means combating terrorism and ISIS?  [Prime Minister Gentiloni spoke in Italian, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Prime Minister Gentiloni. America has played a very key role, first of all, to prevent the consolidation of an important basis for terrorism while Daesh was undergoing defeats in Iraq and Syria. There were operations that were sustained by the U.S. against Daesh in the city of Sirte, which were successful. Now the commitment must be political. And therefore, in the cooperation between U.S. and Italy and other key partners in the region, the goal is to broaden the basis of the consensus for the Tripoli Government, which is recognized by the international community, but which must be able to count on a broader consensus.  I believe that one clear goal should be this: We need the region, and we need countries like Egypt and Tunisia that are close to Libya. We need a stable and unified Libya. A divided country and in conflict would be—would make stability worse. The U.S. job is—the U.S. role, sorry, in this is very critical.  President Trump. I do not see a role in Libya. I think the United States has right now enough roles. We're in a role everywhere. So I do not see that. I do see a role in getting rid of ISIS. We're being very effective in that regard. We are doing a job, with respect to ISIS, that has not been done anywhere near the numbers that we're producing right now. It's a very effective force we have. We have no choice. It's a horrible thing to say, but we have no choice.  And we are effectively ridding the world of ISIS. I see that as a primary role, and that's what we're going to do, whether it's in Iraq or in Libya or anywhere else. And that role will come to an end at a certain point, and we'll be able to go back home and rebuild our country, which is what I want to do.  Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With President Juan Manuel Santos Calderon of Colombia,2017-05-18,"President Santos and I had a very productive meeting, and we will continue to work very closely together to bring peace, safety, and prosperity to the hemisphere. Perhaps no area is really more important in terms of cooperation than our joint effort to end the terrible drug crimes that plague both of our countries.  Recently, we have seen an alarmed—and I mean really a very highly alarmed and alarming trend. Last year, Colombia coca cultivation and cocaine production reached a record high, which, hopefully, will be remedied very quickly by the President. We must confront this dangerous threat to our societies together.  Today I affirmed the United States willingness to assist Colombia's strategy to target and eliminate drug trafficking networks, illicit financings, coca cultivation, and cocaine production, of which there is far too much. The drug epidemic is poisoning too many American lives, and we're going to stop it many different ways. One of them will be the wall.  My administration is committed to keeping drugs and gangs from pouring into our country. Already, border crossings are down more than 73 percent. Secretary Kelly is with us; he's done a fantastic job. Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. And in short, we have a tremendous group of people working with us in terms of ICE, the ICE patrol and the Border Patrol agents. They've done a fantastic job, and I'd like you to give them my highest compliments, Mr. Secretary.  And MS-13, likewise—a horrible, horrible, large group of gangs that have been let into our country over a fairly short period of time—are being decimated by the Border Patrol, by ICE, and by our incredible local police forces. And they are getting out of our country or, in some cases, going directly into prisons throughout our country. But they've literally taken over towns and cities of the United States. They will be gone very quickly.  I look forward to working with President Santos as we target drug trafficking. Both the United States and Colombia have strong law enforcement and security relationship. We've had it and especially over the last fairly short period of time. Together, we will continue to fight the criminal networks responsible for the deadly drug trade that our people have a really strong commitment to getting rid of, because they want a much brighter future.  President Santos and I also discussed the deteriorating situation in Venezuela, and it is really in a very bad state, as you see and as we all see through the media. The stable and peaceful Venezuela is in the best interest of the entire hemisphere, and America stands with all of the people in our great hemisphere yearning to be free. We will be working with Colombia and other countries on the Venezuelan problem. It is a very, very horrible problem. And from a humanitarian standpoint, it is like nothing we've seen in quite a long time. The United States and Colombia are also strong economic partners, and we will continue to pursue trade policies that benefit both of our peoples. The nations' common goals of protecting our citizens, expanding opportunity, and confronting the drug crisis will improve the lives of our people and many throughout the region.  So many people are being so horribly affected by what's going on in terms of violence and in terms of drugs, and we're going to take care of the situation. And we've both agreed to take care of it strongly and quickly.  President Santos, it was an honor to meet with you and your entire group of representatives, very talented people indeed, who have been working with us and my representatives. And I look forward to many more productive meetings, such as the one we just had. I'd like to thank you very much for being at the White House, being our guest. And I'd like to congratulate you on winning the Nobel Peace Prize. That's a very great achievement. Thank you very much.  President Santos. Mr. President, I want to thank you personally for this warm and productive visit and for the strong support Colombia has received from your administration, from Congress, and from the American people.  [At this point, President Santos spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  President Santos. As you know, our nations have had for a long time a strategic alliance and extraordinary friendship. We believe in the same principles of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law. And we work so that the Western Hemisphere can be more prosperous and safe.  The United States and Colombia, they're both democracies of greater—of longer standing in the hemisphere, we have supported each other. Our soldiers fought shoulder to shoulder in the Korean war. At the request of the United States, we sent antidrug experts to Afghanistan. And today, Colombia and the United States are working together to support Central America in their fight against drug cartels and the violence of organized crime.  I can say, Mr. President, based on our conversation this afternoon, that I have no doubt that the United States and Colombia continue to be, today, more than ever, a support, one for the other. Our alliance was strengthened. Our most valuable cooperation has been Plan Colombia, which I can sum up in very simple terms.  When Colombians were fighting to survive—for our democracy to survive, actually—faced with the threat of terrorism and drug trafficking, the United States stretched out a hand and helped us win that battle. We will never forget it.  Today, we live in a different country. Today, Colombia is a more peaceful society, a more modern and a fairer society. In November last year, we ended the longest and last armed conflict existing in our hemisphere. The guerilla is putting down weapons at this precise time to the United Nations. Insecurity has gone down significantly. Today, we have the lowest levels of violence of the last 40 years.  At the same time, we have had significant progress for our citizens on issues such as education, housing, health, and social services. Millions of Colombians have been lifted out of poverty. Today, we continue next to you as partners in Peace Colombia to consolidate peace in the most affected areas. With the robust support of your Government, we are removing thousands of antipersonnel mines that murdered and mutilated children, women, and soldiers. We are healing the wounds of our victims, and we are embarking on a big social development program.  Such as we said today, we are working with your administration to take advantage of the unique opportunity peace offers so as to reduce permanently the production of coca leaf in Colombia and fight more effectively the other links in drug trafficking, including consumption. We must continue and deepen the fight against organized crime, transnational crime responsible not just for drug trafficking, but also for human trafficking and illegal mining.  Our shared agenda, framed within a high-level dialogue that we Colombians value so much, includes cooperation which has allowed us to have unprecedented progress towards quality education for everyone. And this is a priority in the policies of my Government, and we wish to do more with regards to innovation and technology.  With the active participation of the private sector, we have reached trade agreements, investment agreements that are mutually beneficial. This morning we established the entrepreneurial council between the United States and Colombia. We are and wish to continue to be the best destination in Latin America for American businesses. Colombia will continue to be very proudly a close friend and a strategic ally of the United States.  Dear President Trump, I hope you can visit us soon so that you can personally witness the transformation underway in our country. I hope to be able to welcome you to a Colombia in peace, a more equitable Colombia, a better educated Colombia that you have so much contributed to.  Thank you so much.  President Trump. Thank you very much. Does anybody have any questions? [Laughter] I'm shocked.  Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News], go ahead.  Q. Mr. President, thank you very much.  President Trump. Thank you.  Russia's Efforts To Influence the 2016 Presidential Election/Job Creation and Growth/Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  Q. I'd like to get your—Mr. President, I'd like to get your reaction to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's decision to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate the Russia—Russian interference in the campaign. Was this the right move, or is this part of a ""witch hunt""?  President Trump. Well, I respect the move, but the entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself—and the Russians, zero.  I think it divides the country. I think we have a very divided country because of that and many other things. So I can tell you that we want to bring this great country of ours together, Jon. And I will also say very strongly, we've had tremendous success. You look at our job numbers, you look at what's going on at the border, as we discussed before; if you look at what will be happening—you're going to see some incredible numbers with respect to the success of General Mattis and others with the ISIS situation. The numbers are staggering, how successful they've been, the military has been. Tomorrow, as you know, I'm going to Saudi Arabia, going to Israel. I'm going to Rome. And we have the G-7. We have a lot of great things going on.  So I hate to see anything that divides. I'm fine with whatever people want to do, but we have to get back to running this country really, really well. We've made tremendous progress in the last hundred-some-odd days. Tremendous progress. And you see job numbers; you see all of the production that's starting. Plants starting to open again. Haven't been open in years. I'm very proud of it. That's what I want to be focused on. Because, believe me, there's no collusion. Russia is fine. But whether it's Russia or anybody else, my total priority, believe me, is the United States of America.  So thank you very much.  President Santos. [Inaudible]  Venezuela  [A reporter spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Q. President Trump, President Santos, can we say that today we are setting a new roadmap in the relationship between Colombia and the United States? Which are the concrete commitments? You were talking about the postconflict time. Many funds are needed for that.  And on the issue of Venezuela, President Trump, many deaths, human rights violations. There's plenty to be done.  President Trump. Well, that's true. Venezuela is a very, very serious problem. We haven't really seen a problem like that, I would say, Mr. President, in decades, in terms of the kind of violence that we're witnessing. The President was telling me—and I knew—that Venezuela was a very, very wealthy country, just about the wealthiest in your neck of the woods, and had tremendous strengths in so many different ways. And now it's poverty stricken. People don't have enough to eat. People have no food. There's great violence. And we will do whatever is necessary—and we'll work together to do whatever is necessary—to help with fixing that. And I'm really talking on a humanitarian level.  When you look at the oil reserves that they have, when you look at the potential wealth that Venezuela has, you sort of have to wonder, why is that happening? How is that possible? But it's been unbelievably poorly run for a long period of time. And hopefully, that will change, and they can use those assets for the good and to take care of their people. Because right now what's happening is really a disgrace to humanity.  And, Jon, I think you also had a question for the President, if you'd like to.  Q. Does he have another one?  [President Santos spoke briefly in English as follows.]  President Santos. I answered his question about the commitment.  [President Santos continued in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  President Santos. The commitment on President Trump's side and his administration was shown through the approval of the budget that, for Colombia, means an increase in the support to fund the postconflict era. Last night we received from a very important organization, The Atlantic Council, a report, which includes both parties presided by a Republican Senator and a Democrat Senator with a roadmap recommending the governments of the United States and Colombia to follow.  This morning we established this entrepreneurial council, United States-Colombia, so that the private sector can also have a voice in that roadmap. This means we are working together on every front that can be convenient for both countries. But we'll continue to work together. We have ratified that commitment today during our conversation.  And as I said before, we have the best of relations with the United States. We are strategic allies in the region, and we will continue to be so.  Mexico-U.S. Border Security  Mr. Karl. Thank you, Mr. President. President Santos, to you, you heard President Trump say that critical to stopping the flow of drugs into the United States will be the wall that he wants to build on the Mexican border. Do you agree with him? Would that wall be a step, a positive step and a step towards reducing the flow of drugs across the border?  [President Santos spoke in English as follows.]  President Santos. I believe that the best way to fight the drug trafficking is by collaborating. This is not a problem of Colombia only or a problem of the United States only, it's a world problem. And we have to all work together. We declared the war on drugs 40 years ago. The world declared the war on drugs. And it's a war that has not been won. So we must be more effective and more efficient.  Now, we are doing a very big effort, because of the peace process, to have a new strategy: carrot and stick. Stick, by forced eradication. We have already eradicated, this year only, 15,000 hectares, which is the whole volume that we eradicated last year. And we're starting to eradicate—to substitute voluntarily, through a program where the peasants—and we have 80,000 families already in the program—that they are going to substitute for legal crops. And this is the first time that this could be done because of the peace. Before, the conflict did not allow us to build roads and to give these peasants an alternative. Now we have. So we have to take advantage of this opportunity and continue reducing the production of coca.  In the meantime, we will work together, the U.S. and Colombia, with other countries—Central America—to fight the other links of the chain, the intermediaries. We have destroyed 22,000 laboratories in the Colombian jungles, seizing the cocaine in the transit. We have seized record amount of tons last year, and this year, we're doing even better than last year.  So by working together, we can be much more effective, and that is the commitment we just made or ratified this afternoon.  President Trump. And that was a long and very diplomatic answer to your question. [Laughter] I will say it a little bit shorter: Walls work. Just ask Israel. They work. Believe me, they work. And we have no choice.  Peter Baker [New York Times]. Yes.  Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. In the light of a very busy news week, a lot of people would like to get to the bottom of a couple of things, give you a chance to go on record here. Did you at any time urge former FBI Director James Comey in any way, shape, or form to close or to back down the investigation into Michael Flynn?  And also as you look back——  President Trump. No. No. Next question. [Laughter]  Investigation of Russia's Efforts To Influence the 2016 Presidential Election/Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr./Health Care Reform/Job Creation and Growth  Q. Next question. As you look back over the past 6 months or year, have you had any recollection where you've wondered if anything you have done has been something that might be worthy of criminal charges in these investigations or impeachment, as some on the left are implying?  President Trump. I think it's totally ridiculous. Everybody thinks so. And again, we have to get back to working our country properly so that we can take care of the problems that we have. We have plenty of problems. We've done a fantastic job. We have a tremendous group of people. Millions and millions of people out there that are looking at what you had just said and said, ""What are they doing?""  Director Comey was very unpopular with most people. I actually thought when I made that decision—and I also got a very, very strong recommendation, as you know, from the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein. But when I made that decision, I actually thought that it would be a bipartisan decision, because you look at all of the people on the Democratic side—not only the Republican side—that were saying such terrible things about Director Comey.  Then, he had the very poor performance on Wednesday. That was a poor, poor performance, so poor, in fact, that I believe—and you'd have to ask him, because I don't like to speak for other people—but I believe that's why the Deputy Attorney General went out and wrote his very, very strong letter.  And then, on top of that, after the Wednesday performance by Director Comey, you had a person come and have to readjust the record, which many people have never seen before, because there were misstatements made. And I thought that was something that was terrible.  We need a great Director of the FBI. I cherish the FBI. It's special. All over the world, no matter where you go, the FBI is special. The FBI has not had that special reputation with what happened in the campaign, what happened with respect to the Clinton campaign, and even you could say—directly or indirectly—with respect to the much more successful Trump campaign.  We're going to have a Director who is going to be outstanding. I'll be announcing that director very soon, and I look forward to doing it. I think the people in the FBI will be very, very thrilled.  And just in concluding, we look forward to getting this whole situation behind us so that when we go for the jobs, we go for the strong military, when we go for all of the things that we've been pushing so hard and so successfully, including health care—because Obamacare is collapsing. It's dead; it's gone. There's nothing to compare anything to because we don't have health care in this country. You just look at what's happening. Aetna just pulled out. Other insurance companies are pulling out. We don't have health care. Obamacare is a fallacy. It's gone. We need health care. We need to cut taxes. We're going to cut taxes. Forget what I want; it will be the biggest tax cut in the history of our Nation. And that's what I want. It's going to bring back companies. It's going to bring back jobs. We lost so many jobs and so many companies to countries that are not so far from you, Mr. President—they're very close to you, actually—and to many other places throughout the world. We're going to change that. We're going to have expansion.  We already do. You look at what's happening with Ford and with General Motors in Michigan and Ohio. You look at the tremendous number of jobs that are being announced in so many different fields. That's what I'm proud of, and that's what we want to focus our energy on.  The other is something I can only tell you: There was no collusion. And everybody—even my enemies have said, there is no collusion.  So we want to get back and keep on the track that we're on. Because the track that we're on is record setting, and that's what we want to do, is we want to break very positive records.  Thank you. You could ask a question.  President Santos. Ricardo.  [President Santos spoke in English as follows.]  Oh, sorry, you have another question?  Mr. Baker. For you—yes, sir, Mr. President. My question is, as someone who led a nation that's really done a lot of rebuilding and had to rebound from an epidemic of crime and drugs over quite a many years, what do you make of Mr. Trump's America first policy? And further, you've had a tough time with conservative radio, sometimes been called a punching bag. And you've said you have to persevere. I'm curious if you've given any advice to President Trump on how to do so.  [President Santos spoke in English as follows.]  President Santos. I don't think I'm in a position to give any advice to President Trump. He can take care of himself. [Laughter]  And what I—what we did in Colombia, you quite rightly mentioned it, is persevere. We—when you know your port of destination and we know—you know that you're doing the correct thing, you simply have to persevere. And that's what we've done in Colombia, and that's why we were on the verge of being a failed state some years ago. And now we're one of the stars of the region. And that's through hard work, perseverance, and clarity of your objectives. And that's what we have done, and we have to continue, because the trip is not over.  Ricardo Ávila [Portafolio].  Colombian Peace Agreement/Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) Insurgent Group  [A reporter spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  Q. Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about trade. You're about to start the renegotiation of NAFTA. And Colombia—and like other countries in the hemisphere—has a large trade deficit with the United States. Are you worried about the fact that that could contribute to increasing that trade deficit? [The reporter continued in English as follows.]  President Trump, what is your position on the peace process in Colombia?  President Trump. Well, it's been a long process, and it's been a great thing to watch in the sense that the President did a fantastic job. That's not easy after so many years of war. So I'm very, very proud to get to know you, and I really congratulate you. There's nothing tougher than peace, and we want to make peace all over the world. And you are really a great example of somebody that started it.  I mean, FARC is—that was a long, tough situation, as you know very well, coming from the country. But I think the President has done a magnificent job. Not easy. But he's done a magnificent job.  [President Santos spoke in Spanish, and his remarks were translated by an interpreter as follows.]  President Santos. Clearer impossible. [Laughter]  On the trade issue, our deficit with the United States is not so large. It is a moderate deficit, which, of course, both countries will try to increase the volume of trade in both directions and investments also in both directions.  Colombia is becoming an important investor here in the United States, and this is something not many people know. But we have considerable investments in the United States.  We have attempted to give dynamism to these flows of trade, of investment, getting together those main players who are the investors in the private sector. I believe the foundations have been laid. We have the free trade agreement, which is working well. The number of Colombian businesses that are exporting to the United States has grown. And we both believe that we can take greater advantage of those agreements in order to increase flows in both directions for the benefit both of the Colombian and American peoples.  President Trump. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you, thank you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With President Klaus Iohannis of Romania,2017-06-09,"As you know, the people of Romania and America share much in common: a love of freedom, proud cultures, rich traditions, and a vast and storied landscape to call home. The relationship between our two countries stretches back well over a century. But today we especially reaffirm and celebrate our strategic partnership that began more than 20 years ago. That partnership covers many dimensions, including economic, military, and cultural ties. And today we are making those ties even stronger.  Mr. President, your visit comes at an important moment not just in this partnership, but among all of the responsible nations of the world. I have just returned from a historic trip to Europe and the Middle East, where I worked to strengthen our alliances, forge new friendships, and unite all civilized peoples in the fight against terrorism. No civilized nation can tolerate this violence or allow this wicked ideology to spread on its shores. I addressed a summit of more than 50 Arab and Muslim leaders—a unique meeting in the history of nations—where key players in the region agreed to stop supporting terrorism, whether it be financial, military, or even moral support.  The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level, and in the wake of that conference, nations came together and spoke to me about confronting Qatar over its behavior. So we had a decision to make: Do we take the easy road, or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism. I decided—along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, our great generals, and military people—the time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding—they have to end that funding—and its extremist ideology in terms of funding.  I want to call on all other nations to stop immediately supporting terrorism. Stop teaching people to kill other people. Stop filling their minds with hate and intolerance. I won't name other countries, but we are not done solving the problem, but we will solve that problem. We have no choice.  This is my great priority because it is my first duty as President to keep our people safe. Defeating ISIS and other terror organizations is something I have emphasized all during my campaign and right up until the present. To do that, stop funding, stop teaching hate, and stop the killing. For Qatar, we want you back among the unity of responsible nations. We ask Qatar and other nations in the region to do more and do it faster.  I want to thank Saudi Arabia and my friend, King Salman, and all of the countries who participated in that very historic summit. It was truly historic. There has never been anything like it before and perhaps there never will be again. Hopefully, it will be the beginning of the end of funding terrorism. It will, therefore, be the beginning of the end to terrorism. No more funding.  I also want to thank the Romanian people for everything they contribute to our common defense and to the fight against the evil menace of terrorism. They have their own difficulties with it, and they've come a long way, and they're doing a lot. Romania has been a valuable member of the coalition to defeat ISIS, and it's the fourth largest contributor of troops in Afghanistan. There, 23 of your citizens have paid the ultimate price. And America honors their sacrifice.  I want to recognize President Iohannis for his leadership in committing Romania this year to increase its defense spending from 1.4 percent of GDP to over 2 percent. We hope our other NATO allies will follow Romania's lead on meeting their financial obligations and paying their fair share for the cost of defense. But I will say this: that because of our actions, money is starting to pour into NATO. The money is starting to pour in. Other countries are starting to realize that it's time to pay up, and they're doing that. Very proud of that fact.  As you know, I have been an advocate for strengthening our NATO alliance through greater responsibility and burden sharing among member nations. And that is what is happening. Because, together, we can confront the common security challenges facing the world.  Mr. President, I want to applaud your courage and your courageous efforts in Romania to fight corruption and defend the rule of law. This work is necessary to create an environment where trade and commerce can flourish and where citizens can prosper. I look forward to working with you to deepen the ties of both commerce and culture between our two countries.  Romanians have made contributions to the United States and to the world. Very notable among them was Nobel Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, who was born in Romania and, sadly, passed away almost 1 year ago. And I understand that earlier this week, the American Jewish Committee presented President Iohannis with its very prestigious Light Unto the Nations Award for his work to further Holocaust remembrance and education in Romania. I join the AJC in saluting your leadership in that vital cause.  The people of Romania have endured many, many hardships, but they have made a truly remarkable, historical journey. The future of Romania and Romania's relationship with the United States is very, very bright.  President Iohannis, I thank you for your leadership, and I thank you again for being here today. I look forward to strengthening our alliance with your country and our bonds with your people. The relationship has been good, but now it's stronger than ever.  Thank you very much.  President Iohannis. President Trump, thank you so much for the words you found for Romania, for the Romanian people, and for me. Thank you very much for the invitation to be here today with you. And thank you so much for arranging this nice weather in this place.  Mr. President, I'm very glad that we had such a good meeting. And this is due to your strong leadership, and this is also due to our strong partnership. Obviously, the fact that we celebrate 20 years of strategic partnership this year is important for both our nations, and it is important to know—and this is what I want to underline—that this partnership with the United States of America shaped Romania as it is today.  Romania, a solid democracy with a solid and sustainable economic growth. Romania which stands together with the U.S. troops in Afghanistan. We stand together in Iraq. Mr. President, this partnership contributed greatly to what Romania is today. And this partnership was and is very important. And I think this partnership not only has to continue, this partnership has to become stronger. This partnership has to define our bilateral relation, and this partnership has to contribute to solve so many problems.  President Trump, you mentioned terrorism. I'm very glad that, due to your strong leadership, NATO decided to go against terrorism. Your involvement made so many nations conscious of the fact that we have to share the burden inside NATO. And this is why Romania also decided—and if I'm right, I think this is the first country during your mandate—to step up to 2 percent of GDP for defense spending. A significant part of this defense spending is going into strategic acquisitions. And I hope, President Trump, that we find good ways together to use—to make good use of this money.  Romania is very conscious of the fact that we stand on the eastern flank, and we heavily rely on your partnership, President Trump, because we cannot stand there without the U.S. We cannot stand there alone. On the other hand, our partnership has a huge opportunity to step up not only in security matters, but also in commercial and economic matters. And this is very important.  Romania is a member of the European Union. And I think it's the best interest of you, Mr. President, to have a strong European Union as a partner. This is vital for all of us. Our relationship, the transatlantic link is vital. The transatlantic link is not about diplomacy, about policy; it's at the basis of our Western civilization. And together, we will make it stronger. Together, we will make it better.  NATO and the European Union do not have to compete against each other. They have to work together. They have to work in such a manner as to produce synergetic effects: make NATO stronger, make European stronger, make the United States of America stronger.  And this is what we decided, President Trump and I, to make our partnership stronger, better, more enduring. And this will lead very soon to an enhanced economic exchange, to better commerce. And this is what we all decide and what we wish, because we are responsible, President Trump and I, not only for the security. We are responsible for the well-being of our citizens. And this is what we are decided to do.  Thank you so much, President Trump.  President Trump. Thank you.  Dave Boyer, Washington Times, please. Dave. Come on, Dave. Got to get going here, Dave. [Laughter]  Q. Thank you, Mr. President. Apologies.  President Trump. That's all right, Dave.  Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr.'s Testimony Before the Senate Intelligence Committee/2016 Presidential Election  Q. Mr. President, this morning, on Twitter, you were referring to the testimony of James Comey vindicating you. But I wondered if you could tell us in person, sir, why you feel that his testimony vindicated you when it's really—boils down to his word against your word. And if you could also tell us, sir, do tapes exist of your conversations with him?  President Trump. Yes. Well, I'll tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near future. But in the meantime, no collusion, no obstruction. He's a leaker. But we want to get back to running our great country: jobs; trade deficits, we want them to disappear fast; North Korea, a big problem; Middle East, a big problem. So that's what I am focused on. That's what I have been focused on.  But yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction. We are doing really well. That was an excuse by the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldn't have lost, because it's almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the electoral college, as you know. You have to run up the whole East Coast, and you have to win everything as a Republican. And that's just what we did.  So it was a—just an excuse. But we were very, very happy. And frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just weren't true.  Thank you very much.  Do you have a question?  North Atlantic Treaty Organization  Q. Thank you. And, Mr. President, if you could tell us—a couple weeks ago, President Trump was in Brussels at the NATO meeting, and not only was he encouraging NATO members to pay up the 2 percent required of GDP for national defense, but he also was saying that countries, including yours, who had not paid 2 percent in the past should make up for that difference. Do you think that's fair?  President Iohannis. I was in Brussels, and I met President Trump, and I listened to his speech, and I liked it. Because, you see, NATO is based on values, but it is ultimately a military alliance. And you know, military spendings are complicated, and you need a lot of money, because NATO is the strongest alliance the Earth ever saw, and we want to keep it that way.  So we have to spend money for defense purposes. And spending money means, if you're in alliance, everybody has to spend money. This is called burden sharing. And I fully agree, Mr. President, to that.  So of course, some people liked this better, and some didn't like it so much. But it's a simple fact that we have to do this. Not as a purpose in itself; we have to do this to stay strong, to be strong, and to defend our nations.  President Trump. One-hundred percent correct. And you know, one of the things I was referring to during that speech was the fact that, yes, they haven't paid what they should be paying now, but for many years, they haven't been paying. So I said, do we ever go back and say, how about paying the money from many, many years passed?  Now, I know no President has ever asked that question. But I do. And we're going to make NATO very strong. We need the money to make it strong. You can't just do what we've been doing in the past. So I did say, yes, you haven't paid this year, but what about the past years, the many past years where you haven't paid? Perhaps you should pay some or all of that money back.  You have a question?  [At this point, President Iohannis called on a reporter.]  North Atlantic Treaty Organization Q. Thank you. I have a question for President Trump. On the matter of security, sir, you—many of the countries on the eastern flank of NATO, including Romania, see Russia as a threat to the security and the peace in the region. Do you share this vision? And do you think that United States should act under article 5 if any of these countries will be under military aggression?  Thank you very much.  President Trump. Well, I'm committing the United States, and have committed, but I'm committing the United States to article 5. And certainly, we are there to protect. And that's one of the reasons that I want people to make sure we have a very, very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force. But yes, absolutely, I'd be committed to article 5.  [President Iohannis called on another reporter.]  Visa Waiver Program  Q. Thank you. Mr. President, were there any discussion about the Visa Waiver Program for Romania? Is there a timeframe for including our country in this program? Thank you.  President Trump. We didn't discuss it——  President Iohannis. Yes——  President Trump. We didn't discuss it. But there would be certainly—it would be something we will discuss.  Mr. President.  President Iohannis. I mentioned this issue, and I also mentioned it during other meetings I had, because this is important for us, it's important for us; it's important for Romanians who want to come to the United States. And you see, more and more people come, President Trump, from Romania to the United States. Some come as tourists. Some come for business. And those who come for business should be encouraged.  So the matter of visa waiver would be probably important to discuss. And we all hope that we will advance on this.  President Trump. Good.  Oh, look at those hands up there, President. Do you have this in Romania too? I don't know. [Laughter] Oh boy!  Q. Yes. I've got the microphone. If you'll allow me, Mr. President——  President Trump. If I could only sell that. If I could only sell it.  Who would like to ask—should I take one of the killer networks that treat me so badly as fake news? Should I do that? Huh?  Go ahead, Jon [Jonathan Karl, ABC News]. Be fair, Jon.  Q. Oh, absolutely.  President Trump. Remember how nice you used to be before I ran? Such a nice man.  Former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James B. Comey, Jr.'s Testimony Before the Senate Intelligence Committee/Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III/The President's Past Conversations With Former Director Comey Q. Always fair. Mr. President, I want to get back to James Comey's testimony. You suggested he didn't tell the truth in everything he said. He did say, under oath, that you told him to let the Flynn—you said you hoped the Flynn investigation you could let go—he could let——  President Trump. I didn't say that.  Q. So he lied about that?  President Trump. Well, I didn't say that. I mean, I will tell you I didn't say that.  Q. And did he ask you to pledge his loyalty——  President Trump. And there would be nothing wrong if I did say it, according to everybody that I've read today. But I did not say that.  Q. And did he ask for a pledge of loyalty from you? That's another thing he said.  President Trump. No, he did not.  Q. So he said those things under oath. Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events?  President Trump. One-hundred percent. I didn't say under oath—I hardly know the man. I'm not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it. I hardly know the man. It doesn't make sense. No, I didn't say that, and I didn't say the other.  Q. So if Robert Mueller wanted to speak with you about that, you would be willing to talk to him?  President Trump. I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you, Jon.  Q. And you seem to be hinting that there are recordings of those conversations.  President Trump. I'm not hinting anything. I'll tell you about it over a very short period of time.  [Other reporters began asking questions along with Mr. Karl.]  Q. When is that? Is that in public?  President Trump. Okay? Do you have a question here?  Q. When will you tell us about the recordings?  President Trump. Over a fairly short period of time.  Q. Why won't you tell us now, sir?  Q. Tomorrow? Now?  Q. Are there tapes, sir?  President Trump. Oh, you're going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer. Don't worry. [Laughter]  Jon, do you have a question for the President?  Q. Yes. Thank you. And, President Iohannis, you are no stranger to Russian aggression. Vladimir Putin recently suggested that Romania could be in Russia's crosshairs. Are you—how concerned should the world be about Russian aggression in your region? And how concerned should we be here in the United States about what Russia tried to do in our election, sir?  President Iohannis. Everybody is concerned. But you see, being concerned should lead you to being prepared. So in my opinion, we have to be very clear, very simple and very straightforward if we talk about Russia and with Russia. In my opinion, we need dialogue. But on the other hand, we need what we all together decided in NATO, a strong deterrence. So this combination—strong deterrence and dialogue—should lead towards a solution which is feasible for every part.  [President Iohannis called on another reporter.]  Romania-U.S. Relations  Q. Hello, Mr. President Trump. You mentioned earlier the anticorruption fight in Romania. It is a matter of high importance in our country. But we see now that the anticorruption fight and the efforts to consolidate the rule of law are sometimes undermined by some politicians, part of what we can call the Bucharest swamp. Is your administration going to support the anticorruption fight in Romania? And how can you do it? Thank you.  President Trump. Well, we support very strongly Romania. And therefore, obviously, we do support that fight on anticorruption. We will always support that. And we support your President. We think he's done an outstanding job. Very popular, very solid, working very hard. We know everything that's going on. And, yes—and he's going to win that fight. He's going to win that battle. But he has our support.  President Iohannis. Thank you so much.  [Another reporter asked a follow-up question.]  Q. Do you think corruption in Romania is a problem for the U.S.-Romania partnership and for the American investor—[inaudible]—because we still have corruption in Romania, despite this anticorruption fight?  President Trump. Well, you do. But I can tell you that there are many American investors right now going to Romania and investing. In fact, I was given a chart just before our meeting, and we have people going over to Romania and investing, and they weren't doing that a number of years ago. So that shows very, very big progress. And there really are a lot of congratulations in store. But a lot of people are investing from our country to yours.  And people love—from Romania—the United States. And they come here a lot, and we're very proud of them.  Thank you all very much."
"Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference with President Emmanuel Macron of France in Paris, France",2017-07-13,"I think it is both a symbol and very important that the President of the United States could be with us tomorrow on the occasion of our National Day, and attend a military parade, which will -- to which the American troops will take part. We will be also commemorating the 100th anniversary of the American troops joining World War I with the allies in France.  I think it is important because, beyond daily news, we live in countries with roots which are deeper and go further and beyond who we are. So the presence of President Trump was, in my eyes, not only natural, and I think it is also an excellent thing for the history of both our countries.  Earlier today, we started by sharing part of our joint history at the Invalides Museum, the Army Museum. Then we had a working session. And I shall say that I'm extremely pleased about it. We've been able to talk about a number of topics of joint interest, and we underlined a number of shared convictions and, most importantly, a joint roadmap in order to work together in the coming month.  We agreed to implement free and fair trade, and in the field -- and this is the G20, in Hamburg, also expressed in terms of sensitivity. We want to work together in order to implement some efficient measures to tackle dumping anywhere it is taking place in all the fields, by sharing the information that we have and making sure that both the European Union and the United States can take the necessary measures in order to protect within the context of free trade, but of fair, free trade that we can protect all over sectors of activities where we are active. We then had a long discussion which enabled us to cover all of the topics of international policies and the challenges -- the security challenges for the people as well. When it comes to fighting terrorism, from day one I can say that we've seen eye to eye, and we are strongly determined to take any necessary measures in order to root out terrorism and to eradicate it no matter where, in particular the narrative on the Internet. We agreed to strengthen our action and our cooperation in fighting against propaganda. We want to get all the major operators to limit the propaganda, and also tackle cyber criminality. These topics, I believe, are fundamental. And I do hope that we can strengthen the cooperation between both our countries. And it is with a lot of satisfaction that I heard from President Trump the very same approach. And our services will then, therefore, be working together in the coming weeks and months to have a solid action map for that. Regarding the situation in Iraq and in Syria, here again we agreed to continue to work together, in particular in order to be able to launch together some diplomatic initiatives in order to put in place a roadmap for what will come after the war.  We talked about our role, our post-conflict role, but initially we want to put in place a contact group in order to be more efficient, in order to be able to support what is being done by the United Nations, in order to support a political roadmap, in particular for Syria after the war. It is important to put in place some inclusive political solutions for that period of time. We know where destabilization comes from. The roadmap will take care of that. We'll cover it. And we'll also ask our diplomats and our staff to work along those lines so that, in the coming weeks, some concrete initiatives can be taken. And they're supported by the P5. We also share the same intentions regarding Libya. And like I told President Trump, I very much want to take a number of diplomatic initiatives, strong ones, given the situation that we know, and which requires more stability and better control over the region.  On Libya or the Sahel, I think I can say that we have the same vision, a very coherent understanding of the situation in the region, and the same willingness to act very clearly against any form of terrorism and destabilization. Next, climate. Well, here we know what our disagreements are. We have expressed them on a number of occasions. But I think it is important that we can continue to talk about it. I very much respect the decision taken by President Trump. He will work upon implementing his campaign promises. And as far as I'm concerned, I remain attached to the Paris Accord, and we'll make sure that, step by step, we can do everything which is in the accord. Ladies and gentlemen, this is in summary what we've been talking about. We will continue with a friendly tone and informal one this evening. Regarding trade and security for both our countries, the fight against terrorism, stability in the Near and Middle East, in Libya or in the Sahel, I can say that we have a shared determination. The United States is extremely involved in the Iraq War, and I would like to thank President Trump for everything that's been done by the American troops against this background. But I would like him to know that I am fully determined to act together with him in this respect -- fully determined. I very much want both our countries in these matters to increase their cooperation in the coming month, because the threat we are facing is a global one. The enemies -- our enemies are trying to destabilize us by any way. And I believe that this is very much at the heart of the historic alliance between our two countries, and which fully justifies the presence of President Trump today and tomorrow in Paris. Thank you. Thank you, dear Donald. Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well thank you very much, President Macron. And Melania and I are thrilled to join you and Mrs. Macron. This is a wonderful national celebration, and we look very much forward to it. It will be spectacular. Tomorrow -- Bastille Day.  We're honored to be here in your beautiful country -- and it certainly is a beautiful country -- with its proud history and its magnificent people. And thank you for the tour of some of the most incredible buildings anywhere in the world. That was very, very -- a very beautiful thing to see. Thank you. When the French people rose up and stormed the Bastille, it changed the course of human history. Our two nations are forever joined together by the spirit of revolution and the fight for freedom. France is America's first and oldest ally. A lot of people don't know that. Ever since General Lafayette joined the American fight for independence, our fates and fortunes have been tied unequivocally together. It was a longtime ago but we are together, and I think together, perhaps, more so than ever. The relationship is very good. This visit also commemorates another milestone. One century ago, the United States entered World War I. And when the President called me, he had mentioned that fact -- 100 years ago, that was -- I said, Mr. President, I will be there. That's a big, important date -- 100 years.  We remember the tens of thousands of Americans who gave their lives in that valiant and very difficult struggle. We also pay tribute to the heroic deeds of the French Troops whose courage at the Battle of Marne, and countless other battles, will never be forgotten by us. More than one million French soldiers laid down their lives in defense of liberty. Their sacrifice is an eternal tribute to France and to freedom. French and American patriots have fought together, bled together, and died together in the fight for our countries and our civilizations. Today, we face new threats from rogue regimes like North Korea, Iran, and Syria, and the governments that finance and support them. We also face grave threats from terrorist organizations that wage war on innocent lives. Tomorrow will mark one year since a joyous Bastille Day celebration in Nice turned into a massacre. We all remember that, how horrible that was. We mourn the 86 lives that were stolen, and we pray for their loved ones. We also renew our resolve to stand united against these enemies of humanity and to strip them of their territory, their funding, their networks, and ideological support.  Today, President Macron and myself discussed how we can strengthen our vital security partnerships. We just had a meeting with our generals and our representatives, and it went very well. France has excellent counterterrorism capabilities. The French troops are serving bravely in places like Mali to defeat these forces of murder and destruction. The United States and our allies strengthen our commitments to defeat terrorism.  We're also making tremendous progress. Earlier this week, with the strong support of the United States and the Global Coalition, Iraqi forces liberated the city of Mosul from ISIS control. Now we must work with the government of Iraq and our partners and allies in the region to consolidate the gains and ensure that the victory stays a victory, unlike the last time. Last week, the G20 leaders also reaffirmed the right to sovereign nations to control their borders. We must be strong from within to defend ourselves from threats from the outside. The nations of the West also face domestic challenges of our own creation, including vast government bureaucracy that saps the strength from our economies and from our societies.  For this reason, I applaud President Macron on his courageous call for that ""less bureaucracy"" -- it's a good chant -- ""less bureaucracy,"" -- we can use it, too -- and a Europe that protects its citizens. We did not become great through regulation. And in the United States, Mr. President, we also have cut regulations at a level we've never seen before. So we're very proud of that -- over the last six months -- but by allowing our people to follow their dreams. That's what it's all about. To achieve these dreams, however, we must also confront unfair trade practices that hurt our workers, and pursue trade deals that are reciprocal and fair. Both President Macron and I understand our responsibility to prioritize the interests of our countries and, at the same time, to be respectful of the world in which we live. We live in a very complex world. We have to respect it. The United States remains committed to being a leader in environmental protection, while we advance energy security and economic growth.  The friendship between our two nations -- and ourselves, I might add -- is unbreakable. Our occasional disagreements are nothing compared to the immortal bonds of culture, destiny, and liberty that unite us. So strongly unite us, also. As long as we have pride in who we are, where we've come from, how we got here, and what we've achieved as free and democratic nations, then there is nothing we cannot accomplish together.  France helped us secure our independence. A lot of people forget. In the American Revolution, thousands of French soldiers fought alongside American troops so that, as Lafayette said, liberty would have a country. Ever since then, courageous heroes from both nations have fought for the same noble values and the same righteous cause.  Tomorrow, the French Tricolor will once again wave proudly alongside the American Stars and Stripes. Our brave soldiers will march side-by-side, and we will all be inspired to protect and cherish the birthright of freedom that our ancestors won for us with their sweat and with their blood. President Macron, thank you for inviting Melania and myself to this historic celebration. And to you and your spectacular country: May God bless France and may God bless America.  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.  PRESIDENT MACRON: (As interpreted.) Very well. I think we will be taking four questions.  Neither President Trump nor myself have a microphone. (Laughter.)  PRESIDENT TRUMP: He's getting first question, President? Q: (As interpreted.) A question for President Macron regarding what you said on the occasion of the press conference together with Chancellor Merkel. Do you still hope that President Trump -- or did you still hope that President Trump could turn his mind regarding the Paris Accord? And now, President Trump, is it possible for you to come back to the Paris Accord and change your mind? Next, regarding your relation, how would you describe it today? What about the dinner tonight? Is it going to be a dinner between friends?  PRESIDENT MACRON: (As interpreted.) Well, regarding climate -- well, we have a number of disagreements, which are in particular due to the commitments taken by President Trump vis-а-vis his -- during the presidential campaign. So did I. I'm aware of the high importance that that is, but we therefore talked about our disagreement. And we actually discussed the matter even before President Trump reached the decision.  Next, should that have an impact on the discussions we are having on all other topics? No, absolutely not. This is the reason why we share the same views and some major common goals on many other topics or all other topics, which we've been discussing today, and we shall move forward together.  Next -- well, of course, President Trump will tell you about it, but he's made a number of commitments, and we're going to be working together, and my willingness to continue to work with the United States and the President on these very major topics. I understand that it's important to save jobs. That being said, we shall leave the United States of America work on what is its roadmap, and continue to talk about it.  So today there is nothing new, unprecedented, otherwise we would have told you about it. But I believe there is a joint willingness to continue to talk about this and try and find the best possible agreement. As far as I'm concerned, I remain extremely attached to the framework of the Paris Accord, which has been a major international breakthrough, and it is within that framework that I'm working on priorities, including for the European Union. Lastly, as you know, I never very much want to comment who we are and what we are doing, personally. But I can tell you that this evening, at the Eiffel Tower, it will be a dinner between friends, because we are the representatives of two countries which have been allies forever and because we've been able to build a strong relation which is dear to me, because it matters a great deal for both countries. It will, therefore, give me great pleasure to have dinner together with you tonight. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I think that I can reiterate. We have a very good relationship, a good friendship. And we look forward to dinner tonight at the Eiffel Tower. That will be something special. And, yeah, I mean, something could happen with respect to the Paris Accord. We'll see what happens. But we will talk about that over the coming period of time. And if it happens, that will be wonderful. And if it doesn't, that will be okay, too. But we'll see what happens. But we did discuss many things today, including the ceasefire in Syria. We discussed the Ukraine. We discussed a lot of different topics. We briefly hit on the Paris Accord. And we'll see what happens. Yes, ma'am. Go ahead. Q: Thank you. Merci, Mr. President. Mr. President, your FBI nominee said if someone in a campaign got an email about Russia, like the one that your son Don Jr. received, that they should alert the FBI rather than accept that meeting. Is he wrong? Also, were you misled by your team in not knowing about this meeting? And, Mr. President, thank you very much. You have heard President Trump say that it may have been Russia, it may have been others who interfered with the U.S. election. Is President Trump taking a hard-enough line on Russia, as you see it? Merci. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I'll start off by saying, first of all, I believe that we will have a great FBI director. I think he's doing really well, and we're very proud of that choice. I think I've done a great service to the country by choosing him. He will make us all proud, and I think someday we'll see that -- and hopefully someday soon. So, we're very proud of him. As far as my son is concerned, my son is a wonderful young man. He took a meeting with a Russian lawyer, not a government lawyer, but a Russian lawyer. It was a short meeting. It was a meeting that went very, very quickly, very fast. Two of the people in the room, they -- I guess one of them left almost immediately and the other one was not really focused on the meeting. I do think this: I think from a practical standpoint, most people would have taken that meeting. It's called opposition research, or even research into your opponent. I've had many people -- I have only been in politics for two years, but I've had many people call up -- ""Oh, gee, we have information on this factor or this person, or, frankly, Hillary."" That's very standard in politics. Politics is not the nicest business in the world, but it's very standard where they have information and you take the information. In the case of Don, he listened. I guess they talked about -- as I see it, they talked about adoption and some things. Adoption wasn't even a part of the campaign. But nothing happened from the meeting. Zero happened from the meeting. And, honestly, I think the press made a very big deal over something that, really, a lot of people would do. Now, the lawyer that went to the meeting, I see that she was in the halls of Congress, also. Somebody said that her visa or her passport to come into the country was approved by Attorney General Lynch. Now, maybe that's wrong. I just heard that a little while ago. But a little surprised to hear that. So she was here because of Lynch. So, again, I have a son who's a great young man. He's a fine person. He took a meeting with a lawyer from Russia. It lasted for a very short period, and nothing came of the meeting. And I think it's a meeting that most people in politics probably would have taken. Mr. President. PRESIDENT MACRON: (In English.) Yes, to answer your question, I will not interfere in U.S. domestic policy. And I think it's always good between partners and allies not to interfere in others' domestic life. PRESIDENT TRUMP: What a good answer that was. (Laughter.) PRESIDENT MACRON: (In English.) And I do believe that both of us have a direct relationship with Russia. President Trump had more than two hours meeting with President Putin during this past G20. So that's -- I had two very long meetings with President Putin, the very first one in Versailles and the second one during the G20. And this relationship is very important. We have a lot of disagreements. We have a lot of discrepancies, obviously, with Russia. But in the current environment, especially in the Middle East, it's a necessity to work together, to work together, to exchange information, to share disagreements, and to try to build solutions.  So that's my relationship with Russia. And we don't have, obviously, the same relationship as the one with the U.S. But that's a longstanding relationship with Russia as well, and I think it's important that both of us have direct discussion and contact with President Putin. PRESIDENT TRUMP: One of the great things that came out of that meeting, by the way -- even though it's not part of the question -- was the fact that we got a ceasefire that now has lasted for, I guess, Mr. President, almost five days. And while five days doesn't sound like a long period of time, in terms of a ceasefire in Syria, that's a very long period of time. And that was a result of having communication with a country. So, during that five-day period, a lot of lives have been saved. A lot of people were not killed. No shots have been fired in a very, very dangerous part of the world, and this is one of the most dangerous parts of Syria itself.  So by having some communication and dialogue, we were able to have this ceasefire, and it's going to go on for a while. And, frankly, we're working on a second ceasefire in a very rough part of Syria. And if we get that and a few more, all of a sudden you're going to have no bullets being fired in Syria. And that would be a wonderful thing. Mr. President, you have a question. PRESIDENT MACRON: (As interpreted.) Third question from BFN TV.  Q: (As interpreted.) A question to President Macron. You went to Lausanne in order to support Paris's bid for the Olympic Games, and on this occasion you somehow criticized President Trump's policy without naming him. You said that France made a very clear choice to leave its border open and not to build walls to protect its people. Do you condemn the Muslim ban and the building of the wall between the United States and Mexico? Regarding Syria, as it was just mentioned by President Trump, is France ready to talk directly with Bashar al-Assad in the negotiation that you mentioned? (In English.) You've mentioned a friend, Jim, who told you that Paris is no longer Paris. You were implying at the time that Paris was not safe anymore. You've also said that France and Germany are infected by terrorism and ""it's their fault because they let people enter their territory."" Those are very strong words. Would you repeat them today? And do you still believe that France is not able to fight terrorism on its own territory? Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: You better let me answer that one first. That's a beauty. (Laughter.) He's the one that asked the question. That wasn't even one of my picks.  You know what, it's going to be just fine because you have a great President. You have somebody that's going to run this country right. And I would be willing to bet -- because I think this is one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities in the world -- and you have a great leader now, you have a great President, you have a tough President. He's not going to be easy on people that are breaking the laws and people that show this tremendous violence.  So I really have a feeling that you're going to have a very, very peaceful and beautiful Paris, and I'm coming back. You better do a good job, please. (Laughter.) Otherwise you're going to make me look very bad. PRESIDENT MACRON: (In English.) And you're always welcome. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you. PRESIDENT MACRON: (As interpreted.) Regarding the first question, like I said, I believe that the discussions that we've had today is the proper answer to terrorism. The right answer is strengthen cooperation between our services and a never-ending fight against terrorists no matter where they are. This is what I was referring to, this is what we're working on actively together.  So, in this respect, there is no difference and no gap between the French and the American positions. When I have something to say, I say it clearly, and I do say who I'm aiming at. And when I refer to those who have been my opponents in the French political battle, I also mention the names. So let us not mix up everything. And regarding the fight against terrorism, I think the right approach is to have strengthened cooperation in the field of intelligence, is also to be working together on all the theaters of operation where we are. And I think that the decisions we've reached today will enable us to do more.  Next, your question regarding Bashar al-Assad, which is an important one. Let me put it simply: Indeed, we now have a new approach of Syria because we want some results and we want to be closely working together with our partners, including the United States of America. We have one main goal, which is to eradicate terrorism. No matter who they are, we want to build an inclusive and sustainable political solution. Against that background, I do not require Assad's departure. This is no longer a prerequisite for France to work on that, because I can only tell you that, for seven years, we did not have an embassy in Damascus, and still we have no solution.  Next, we also have a common red line, together with President Trump. He intervened before I was elected, and I said it to President Putin after my election: No use whatsoever of chemical weapons. Any use will lead to reaction -- an attack against a reaction regarding the storage places.  Next, we also want humanitarian corridors. Also, we want to build a sustainable political stability for Syria. This is our roadmap. In order to stick to it, we need diplomatic initiative beyond our military actions. This is what we've been agreeing upon, because we want to take an initiative with the members of the Security Council and a number of countries involved in the process. Of course, there will be representatives of Assad that will enable us to put in place the roadmap for after the war, but there will also be representatives of the opposition and people with different backgrounds, and we will talk to all of them against that background. One last question for an American journalist. Q: Thank you. (Inaudible) TV of China. (As interpreted.) For both Presidents: Mr. Macron, you had your first meeting with the Chinese President during the G20 Summit. What will France do? How will France cooperate with all of these areas with China? And what do you think personally of Mr. Xi Jinping? (In English.) Mr. President, you have just met the Chinese President during the G20 Summit. How do you want to continue to work with China? And what do you personally think about Mr. Xi Jinping? Thank you very much. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, he's a friend of mine. I have great respect for him. We've gotten to know each other very well. A great leader. He's a very talented man. I think he's a very good man. He loves China, I can tell you. He loves China. He wants to do what's right for China.  We've asked him for some assistance with respect to North Korea. Probably, he could do a little bit more, but we'll find out. We're now working on some trade deals. He's been very nice. He's let, as you know, beef go back in, certain financing go back in, credit card financing, and various other things go back in at my request, which is a great thing for our farmers. A lot of good things are happening, but we're going to be working on some very major trade components.  But President Xi is a terrific guy. I like being with him a lot, and he's a very special person.  Okay, thank you.  PRESIDENT MACRON: (As interpreted.) I first talked to President Xi over the telephone, and then I got to meet him in the margin of the G20 Summit in Hamburg. Early next year I will be traveling to China. We've agreed to it. So I cannot say that he's a friend of mine or that I know him very well because I very much want to say things as they are. But we had some initial contacts which were extremely fruitful and positive.  I have a lot of respect for President Xi, and I would like to say that over the past few months he did express his willingness to have a vision for multilateralism and wanted to commit himself on a number of topics. I think that many of us remember his words in Davos, and he there very strongly expressed his vision of the role of China. We have a number of joint commitments, including on climate. He's very committed to that, and he told me that he wanted to do more in the field, and I can only be happy about it. He wants strong cooperation.  And like President Trump said, the trade issues and regarding the number of activities -- there are issues, there are differences, but a joint willingness to sort them out. And as permanent members of the Security Council, we want to work together on all of the topics we've been discussing today.  And China, in this respect, is a key partner in order to build peace all around the world, and I share what President Trump just said, that China is to play a very specific role regarding the rising tension, the growing tension with North Korea. It's important that China can play fully its role in the region. In summary, I think he is today one of the great leaders of our world, implementing a major and ambitious reform of China society and the economy in China. And therefore my willingness, in this respect as well, is to have strategic dialogue, the purpose of which is to continue to talk about the industry of -- civil nuclear industry, economic matters, and talk about any difficulties we may have together. Very well. Allow me to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and once again thank President Trump for his visit. And I will be seeing him in a few moments in a friendly atmosphere. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you."
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference with Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon,2017-07-25,"I want to thank Senator John McCain -- very brave man. He made a tough trip to get here and vote. So we want to thank Senator McCain and all of the Republicans. We passed it without one Democrat vote. And that's a shame but that's the way it is, and it's very unfortunate.  But I want to congratulate American people because we're going to give you great healthcare. And we're going to get rid of Obamacare which should have been, frankly, terminated long ago. It's been a disaster for the American people.  Thank you very much. Good afternoon and thank you all for being here. It is my honor to welcome Prime Minister Saad Hariri of Lebanon to the White House.  The Prime Minister and I have just concluded an extensive conversation about the challenges and opportunities facing Lebanon and its neighbors. Lebanon is on the front lines in the fight against ISIS, Al Qaeda, and Hizballah. The Lebanese people, of all faiths, are working together to keep -- and you know this, and we've been discussing this at great length -- their country safe and prosperous. They love their country, and they're going to keep it safe and prosperous.  Mr. Prime Minister, I want to commend you and your people for standing up for humanity in a very troubled part of the world. The ties between our two countries stretch back more than a century. Long, long relationships.  In 1866, American missionaries founded the American University of Beirut. Now, more than 150 years later -- and with ongoing American support -- this university continues to educate generations of leaders in the region.  Today, our two countries seek to strengthen our relationship in many ways, including the pursuit of stability, mutual prosperity, and peace. What the Lebanese Armed Forces have accomplished in recent years is very impressive. In 2014, when ISIS tried to invade northern Lebanon, the Lebanese army beat them back. Since that time, the Lebanese army has been fighting continually to guard Lebanon's border and prevent ISIS and other terrorists -- of which there are many -- from gaining a foothold inside their country.  The United States military has been proud to help in that fight and will continue to do so. America's assistance can help ensure that the Lebanese army is the only defender Lebanon needs. It's a very effective fighting force. Threats to the Lebanese people come from inside, as well. Hizballah is a menace to the Lebanese state, the Lebanese people, and the entire region. The group continues to increase its military arsenal, which threatens to start yet another conflict with Israel, constantly fighting them back. With the support of Iran, the organization is also fueling the humanitarian catastrophe in Syria. Hizballah likes to portray itself as a defender of Lebanese interests, but it's very clear that its true interests are those of itself and its sponsor -- Iran. I have repeatedly emphasized that Syria's neighbors in the Middle East must take responsibility for helping Syrian refugees until they can return home and rebuild their country. The Lebanese people have led the way, accepting more Syrian refugees per capita than any other nation. It's not even close. I want to thank the Prime Minister and the Lebanese people for giving shelter to those victimized by ISIS, the Assad regime, and their supporters and sponsors, and pledge our continued support to Lebanon.  Since the start of the Syrian crisis, the United States has helped Lebanon support Syrian refugees with clean water, food, shelter, and health care. Our approach, supporting the humanitarian needs of displaced Syrian citizens as close to their home country as possible, is the best way to help most people. America is proud to stand with those who have the courage to stand up to terrorism and take responsibility for affairs in their own region. The reliance and resilience of the Lebanese people in the face of war and terror is extraordinary. We honor the citizens of Lebanon who are working to secure a future of peace, stability, and prosperity for their children. Mr. Prime Minister, I'm grateful that you're here today. It's a big day in our country because of the vote that you just heard about. We stood and watched the results on television before coming out, and you found it very interesting, I hope -- PRIME MINISTER HARIRI: Yes, I did. PRESIDENT TRUMP: -- and very important. I look forward to working with you to strengthen our partnership and the enduring friendship between the American and Lebanese peoples.  Thank you very much. Mr. Prime Minister. PRIME MINISTER HARIRI: Thank you. Good afternoon. I had the honor and pleasure -- and the pleasure to hold a very good meeting with President Trump. I appreciate his leadership and the United States' leadership in the world today. We discussed the situation in our region and the efforts we, in Lebanon, are making to safeguard our political and economic stability, while combatting terrorism.  I thank President Trump for his support to our army and security agencies, as well as his support to maintaining peace and stability along our southern border, where our government is committed to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, as well as all resolutions. We also discussed the pressures Lebanon is facing as a result of 1.5 million Syrians displaced in our country. I outlined to President Trump my government's vision for dealing with this crisis with the support of the international community. We also discussed economic prospects in Lebanon and our government's effort to jumpstart inclusive economic growth with a particular emphasis on job creation. I thank President Trump and the United States of America for their support to the Lebanese people, striving to keep their country a model of moderation, dialogue, coexistence, and democratic governance in our region. Thank you.  PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much.  Margaret Talev, please. Q: Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Hello, Margaret. Q: Hi. Hi, Mr. President. Mr. Prime Minister, I'll have a question for you also in just a second, if you'll bear with me.  You spoke earlier today with The Wall Street Journal -- we've all seen those comments -- but I think everybody here probably is hoping that you could talk a little bit more about this. You have called your Attorney General ""beleaguered."" You have criticized his decision to recuse himself on the Russia matters. And your, kind of, catch-phrase or motto before the White House was, ""You're fired."" So I'm wondering if you would talk to us a little bit about whether you've lost confidence in Jeff Sessions, whether you want him to resign on his own, whether you're prepared to fire him if he doesn't, and why you're sort of letting him twist in the wind rather than just making the call for him. Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I don't think I am doing that, but I am disappointed in the Attorney General. He should not have recused himself almost immediately after he took office. And if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me prior to taking office, and I would have, quite simply, picked somebody else. So I think that's a bad thing not for the President, but for the presidency. I think it's unfair to the presidency. And that's the way I feel. Thank you. Q: Thank you. Mr. Prime Minister, could you tell us what you think about the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar? This is something that has been of great concern to the U.S. also in terms of resolving. Do you think that Qatar is doing enough on terror? And if so, would you like to see President Trump increase the pressure on the Saudi coalition to ease its blockade? And, Mr. President, if you would give us any more of your thinking on, going forward, the path with Attorney General Sessions, and maybe your timeline for making a decision, that would be great. Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: You don't give up. That's okay. PRIME MINISTER HARIRI: Thank you. I think there is an effort by the Kuwaitis. They're leading this effort. And I think they made some progress. We believe that dialogue is the best way in improving this relationship between Saudi Arabia and Qatar. I believe that maybe the United States also could help in solving this issue in the Gulf. Denise (ph). Q: I have one question for the President and also for the Prime Minister. Congress introduced additional sanctions against Hizballah last week. What is your position towards these sanctions and on the role Hizballah is playing in the region and Syria? PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'll be making my position very clear over the next 24 hours. We're going to see what is exactly taking place. I have meetings with some of my very expert military representatives and others, so I'll be making that decision very shortly. Okay? Thank you. Q: And about its role in Syria and the region? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Whose role? Q: Hizballah's role. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'll be talking about that tomorrow. Q: (No translation provided.) PRIME MINISTER HARIRI: (No translation provided.)  PRESIDENT TRUMP: Blake Burman. Thank you. Hello, Blake. Q: President Trump, hello. Thank you. Indulge us here for a second. Just to pick up where Margaret left off, the American people I think would like to know: Do you feel that the Attorney General should indeed stay? Do you intend on firing him? Why should he remain as the Attorney General? And, secondly, on a separate topic, with the healthcare vote that just came about, there is a still long ways to go. At what point do you feel that Republicans, if they can't get something done, should just say, you know what, we gave it a go, let's move on to tax reform instead? Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want the Attorney General to be much tougher on the leaks from intelligence agencies, which are leaking like rarely have they ever leaked before, at a very important level. These are intelligence agencies. We cannot have that happen. You know many of my views in addition to that, but I think that's one of the very important things that they have to get on with. I told you before, I'm very disappointed with the Attorney General, but we will see what happens. Time will tell. Time will tell. On healthcare, I'm extremely happy that we got this vote. They say, if you look historically, this is the tough vote to get. Now we're all going to sit together and we're going to try and come up with something that's really spectacular. We have a lot of options, and a lot of great options. And the Republican senators really went out there. It's not easy when you have 52 senators and you have a bloc of 48 voting against you. No matter what it is, no matter how good it sounds, it's very hard to get the kind of numbers that we got. We ended up with 51 votes -- 51 to whatever. I don't know what it is. Yeah, 51-50.  So we had two Republicans that went against us, which is very sad, I think. It's very, very sad -- for them. But I'm very, very happy with the result. I believe now we will, over the next week or two, come up with a plan that's going to be really, really wonderful for the American people.  Obamacare is a disaster. It's failing on every front. It's too expensive. It gives horrible coverage. It was gotten by a lie, 28 times. It was a lie. ""You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan"" -- all lies. And the people are sick of it. And we're going to come up with a great healthcare that satisfies the needs of the people that we serve, which is the people of the United States.  I will say -- and I said it right at the beginning -- healthcare is always difficult because you have to weed a very, very narrow path, like a quarter of an inch wide, right down the middle. And if you go a little bit too far right, you lose three people on the left. And if you go a little bit too far left, you lose five people on the right. It is a very, very complex and difficult task, but it's something I actually know quite a bit about. I want to just thank some of the Republican senators, who were really fantastic in getting us here, in particular John McCain for making the trip.  But I think you're going to have a great healthcare. This is the beginning of the end for the disaster known as Obamacare. Thank you very much. Q: Mr. President, how can the United States help Lebanon cope with the massive number of refugees -- of Syrian refugees? And is there a way you can help facilitate the refugees' return to their home country? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we are helping. And one of the things that we have made tremendous strides at is getting rid of ISIS. We have generals that don't like to talk; they like to do. And we were with General Mattis last night, and the success they've had against ISIS is extraordinary. We've made more progress in the last four or five months than previous -- really, I could say, the previous administration made in eight years. And then we have to see what we have to see. But I will tell you, ISIS in Syria, ISIS in Iraq, ISIS in other locations -- we have made tremendous strides. Our military is an incredible fighting force. And as you know, I let the commanders on the ground do what they had to do. Before, they used to have to call in this beautiful house and speak to people that didn't know what was happening -- where they were, what locations -- practically, probably never heard of the countries they were talking about, or the towns. I let the generals do what they had to do. And we have made tremendous plans. We were discussing it just before. We have made tremendous gains with respect to ISIS in Syria, Iraq, and other places.  Thank you. Q: What about Bashar al-Assad in Syria? PRESIDENT TRUMP: Assad? Q: Assad. PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm not a fan of Assad, okay? He will tell you that, because we hit 58 out of 58, or, you could even say, 59 out of 59, when we launched the Tomahawk missiles. No, I am not a fan of Assad. I certainly think that what he's done to that country and to humanity is horrible. So, I have been saying that for a long time. I am not somebody that will stand by and let him get away with what he tried to do. And he did it a number of times -- when President Obama drew the red line in the sand. And then he should have crossed that red line, because some horrible acts against humanity took place, including gas and the killing through gases. That was a bad day for this country. And I'd go a step further that, had President Obama gone across that line and done what he should have done, I don't believe you'd have Russia and I don't believe you'd have Iran to anywhere near the extent, and maybe not at all, in Syria today. Thank you very much. Q: (No translation provided.) PRIME MINISTER HARIRI: (No translation provided.) Q: (No translation provided.) PRIME MINISTER HARIRI: (No translation provided.) PRESDIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much, everybody. Appreciate it. Thank you. PRIME MINISTER HARIRI: Thank you so much. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Mr. Prime Minister, thank you."
