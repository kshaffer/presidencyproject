"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9571—National School Choice Week, 2017",2017-01-26,"The foundation of a good life begins with a great education. Today, too many of our children are stuck in schools that do not provide this opportunity.  Because the education of our young people is so important, the parents of every student in America should have a right to a meaningful choice about where their child goes to school.  By expanding school choice and providing more educational opportunities for every American family, we can help make sure that every child has an equal shot at achieving the American Dream. More choices for our students will make our schools better for everybody.  Our country is home to many great schools and many extraordinary teachers—whether they serve in traditional public schools, public charter schools, magnet schools, private or religious schools, or in homeschooling environments.  With a renewed commitment to expanding school choice for our children, we can truly make a great education possible for every child in America.  I commend our Nation's students, parents, teachers, and school leaders for their commitment to quality, effective education, and I call on States and communities to support effective education and school choice for every child in America.  As our country celebrates National School Choice Week, I encourage parents to evaluate the educational opportunities available for their children. I also encourage State lawmakers and Federal lawmakers to expand school choice for millions of additional students.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 22 through January 28, 2017, as National School Choice Week.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9572—National African American History Month, 2017",2017-02-01,"As we celebrate National African American History Month, we recognize the heritage and achievements of African Americans. The contributions African Americans have made and continue to make are an integral part of our society, and the history of African Americans exemplifies the resilience and innovative spirit that continue to make our Nation great.  For generations, African Americans have embodied the shared progress of our Nation. Through toil and struggle and with courageous actions that have broken barriers, they have made America a better place to live and work for everybody. Women like Katherine Johnson, a pioneer in space history whose work helped America win the Space Race, and Madam C.J. Walker, who became one of the most successful female entrepreneurs of her time, paved the way for both women and African Americans in their respective fields. Robert Smalls, a man born into slavery, founded our Nation's first free and compulsory public school system. Later in life, he served as a lawmaker in South Carolina's State legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. The strength and determination of men and women like these remind us that our Nation brims with people whose contributions continue to make it stronger and better.  This year, African American History Month calls upon us to reflect on the crucial role of education in the history of African Americans. It reminds us of the importance of teaching and reflecting upon the many roles African Americans have played in building this Nation and driving it forward. This year's theme also calls upon us to rededicate ourselves to the work of ensuring that all children in this Nation have access to quality educational opportunities that give them the skills, experiences, relationships, and credentials that can empower them to follow in the footsteps of people like Katherine Johnson, Madam C.J. Walker, and Robert Smalls.  As we journey toward a stronger, more united Nation, let us use this commemoration of African American History Month to serve as a reminder of the need for meaningful dialogue and shared commitment to collective action that uplifts and empowers, as well as of the strength, ingenuity, and perseverance required of us in the years to come.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2017 as National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9573—American Heart Month, 2017",2017-02-02,"The death rate from heart disease in the United States has fallen dramatically since the 1960s, a significant public health victory. Despite this progress, heart disease remains a leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, and we must reduce its toll. During American Heart Month, we remember those who have lost their lives to heart disease and resolve to improve its prevention, detection, and treatment. It is a time for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to improving cardiovascular health—for ourselves, our families, and our communities.  Over the past several decades, we have learned much about factors that contribute to heart disease, how to monitor those triggers, and ways to treat them. We know that individuals can live longer and better lives by refraining from tobacco use, maintaining an optimal blood pressure and a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Innovative companies continue to offer new tools and online systems, giving people more access than ever to information they can use to make informed, health-conscious choices.  Scientific research and evidence-based interventions to prevent or treat heart attacks and strokes have played an important part in making these strides. Developments in technology and the discovery of early markers of heart disease have allowed us to diagnose and treat heart disease sooner than ever before. American innovators continue to develop treatments for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and our health care providers continue to promote best strategies and educate Americans to stay heart healthy.  To highlight the importance of preventing heart disease, Melania and I invite all Americans to wear red this Friday, February 3, 2017, to observe National Wear Red Day. Working together on National Wear Red Day, and throughout the year, we can raise awareness about heart disease and make our Nation healthier.  In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved on December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as American Heart Month.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2017 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 3, 2017. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9574—American Red Cross Month, 2017",2017-03-01,"For more than 135 years, the American Red Cross has stepped into the breach, providing shelter, food, and emotional support to victims of natural disaster, war, conflict, and unexpected hardship. Today, the Red Cross is responsible for a remarkable 40 percent of our Nation's blood supply, teaches life-saving techniques to volunteer citizen-rescuers, and leads the world in international humanitarian aid. The Red Cross has proudly and ardently supported our military, our veterans, and their families for more than a century, delivering over 352,000 services to members of the military and veterans each year.  The American Red Cross is a miracle-working organization, rooted in the legacy of its gallant founder, Clara Barton, who tore down every convention at the time regarding women in battle, giving history one of the most incredible examples of courage and devotion to duty that it has ever known. Her tremendous legacy lives on through the Red Cross's assistance to hundreds of thousands of Americans affected by disasters each year. In 2016, volunteers responded to 180 significant incidents, including wildfires, storms, flooding, Hurricane Matthew, and other emergencies at all times of the day and night. They opened nearly 800 emergency shelters, served more than 4.1 million meals and snacks, and distributed more than 2.1 million relief items. Last year, the Red Cross helped 79,000 families recover from home fires that left them with no place to go.  The comfort, care, and relief provided by the American Red Cross serves a great mission. When those in need see that recognizable symbol of hope, the Red Cross, they see the hearts of the American people at work—an incredibly powerful thing. When they see that beacon, they know that true help is on the way, and they feel our people's mighty generosity, love, and support for their fellow human beings.  To perform its vital national and international roles, the Red Cross relies on volunteers and the support of the American people. The Red Cross needs our continued commitment of time, resources, and funds to be successful, and our country and the world need the Red Cross.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as American Red Cross Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and by supporting the work of service and relief organizations.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9575—Irish-American Heritage Month, 2017",2017-03-01,"Irish Americans have made an indelible mark on the United States. From Dublin, California, to Limerick, Maine, from Emerald Isle, North Carolina, to Shamrock, Texas, we are reminded of the more than 35 million Americans of Irish descent who contribute every day to all facets of life in the United States. Over generations, millions of Irish have crossed the ocean in search of the American Dream, and their contributions continue to enrich our country today.  From our four Irish-born Founding Fathers to Thomas Francis Meagher, the Irish revolutionary who became an American hero after leading the Irish Brigade during the Civil War, Irish immigrants have shaped our history in enduring ways. Throughout the centuries, hard-working Irish Americans have contributed to America's innovation and prosperity—tilling the farms of Appalachia, working the looms of New England textile mills, and building transcontinental railroads—often overcoming poverty and discrimination and inspiring Americans from all walks of life with their indomitable and entrepreneurial spirit in the process. From these early beginnings rose generations of Irish Americans who continue to lead our cities, drive our economy, and protect and defend the land they embrace as their own.  American culture carries an unmistakably Irish-American imprint. Our literature, cinema, music, dance, sports, and visual arts are filled with the names and influence of great Irish Americans.  Irish Americans should be proud of the deep cultural, historical, and familial ties that have contributed to the strength of our vibrant transatlantic relationship with Ireland. As we honor the past during Irish-American Heritage Month, we also celebrate a bright future of friendship and cooperation for generations to come.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as Irish-American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9576—Women's History Month, 2017",2017-03-01,"We are proud of our Nation's achievements in promoting women's full participation in all aspects of American life and are resolute in our commitment to supporting women's continued advancement in America and around the world.  America honors the celebrated women pioneers and leaders in our history, as well as those unsung women heroes of our daily lives. We honor those outstanding women, whose contributions to our Nation's life, culture, history, economy, and families have shaped us and helped us fulfill America's promise.  We cherish the incredible accomplishments of early American women, who helped found our Nation and explore the great western frontier. Women have been steadfast throughout our battles to end slavery, as well as our battles abroad. And American women fought for the civil rights of women and others in the suffrage and civil rights movements. Millions of bold, fearless women have succeeded as entrepreneurs and in the workplace, all the while remaining the backbone of our families, our communities, and our country.  During Women's History Month, we pause to pay tribute to the remarkable women who prevailed over enormous barriers, paving the way for women of today to not only participate in but to lead and shape every facet of American life. Since our beginning, we have been blessed with courageous women like Henrietta Johnson, the first woman known to work as an artist in the colonies; Margaret Corbin, who bravely fought in the American Revolution; and Abigail Adams, First Lady of the United States and trusted advisor to President John Adams.  We also remember incredible women like Mary Walker, the first woman to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor; Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery in 1849 and went on to free hundreds of others through the Underground Railroad; Susan B. Anthony, the publisher and editor of The Revolution and her friend, Dr. Charlotte Lozier, one of the first women medical doctors in the United States, both of whom advocated for the dignity and equality of women, pregnant mothers, and their children; Rosa Parks, whose refusal to give up her seat accelerated the modern civil rights movement; Shirley Temple Black, the famous actress turned diplomat and first chief of protocol for the President of the United States; Anna Bissell, the first woman CEO in American history; Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean; Ella Fitzgerald, the First Lady of Song and the Queen of Jazz; and Sally Ride, the first American woman astronaut.  America will continue to fight for women's rights and equality across the country and around the world. Though poverty holds back many women, America cannot and will not allow this to persist. We will empower all women to pursue their American dreams, to live, work and thrive in safe communities that allow them to protect and provide for themselves and their families.  America is also mindful of the fight that continues for so many women around the world, where women are often not protected and treated disgracefully as second-class citizens. America will fight for these women too, and it will fight to protect young girls who are robbed of their rights, trafficked around the world, and exploited. Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as Women's History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9577—National Consumer Protection Week, 2017",2017-03-06,"The economic strength and vitality of our Nation is directly linked to our consumers' confidence in the integrity and security of their personal information and the robust protection of their privacy. As an increasing number of transactions and activities occur online, the safety of vital consumer information is increasingly at risk. The American people deserve freedom from unscrupulous actors who perpetrate identity theft, abuse personal information, or engage in fraud.  Cyber crimes, which defraud hard-working Americans, cost our families billions of dollars each year and result in tremendous stress, loss of time, and hardship. Americans must have access to the tools necessary to protect their personal information and privacy and know how to use them to improve their online security. Our first defense against fraudulent cyber transactions and the misuse of personal information will always be a well-informed consumer.  National Consumer Protection Week reminds us of the importance of empowering consumers by helping them to more capably identify and report cyber scams, monitor their online privacy and security, and make well-informed decisions. The Federal Government, in conjunction with a network of national organizations and State and local partners, provides consumer education resources to help Americans protect their personal information. These resources assist military service members and their families, identity-theft victims, and all potentially vulnerable consumers. Our work to protect consumers from identity theft, abuse of personal information, and fraud, and to improve the integrity and security of our marketplaces, enhances the prosperity of our great country.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 5 through March 11, 2017, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon government officials, industry leaders, and advocates to educate our citizens about the protection of personal information and identity theft through consumer education activities in communities across the country.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9578—National Poison Prevention Week, 2017",2017-03-17,"The United States has made great strides in preventing unintentional childhood poisoning deaths. Thanks to combined national, State, and local efforts over the course of years, Americans have reduced childhood fatalities related to accidental poisoning in the United States from 200 deaths per year to 27 per year, which is an 88 percent decline. From a public health perspective, this is a resounding achievement.  Fifty-five years ago, President John F. Kennedy noted that virtually all deaths attributable to accidental poisoning could be prevented. He was right—we as a society must do much more to prevent tragic and preventable loss of life from occurring. Ensuring the safety and security of the American people requires that we unequivocally commit to a continuation of the successful policies that have reduced accidental childhood poisonings and injuries.  This week we warn all Americans about unintended exposure to poisons and the threat of household items unintentionally being turned into deadly weapons. This is an important reminder—and one that could save lives.  To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of unintentional poisonings and to take appropriate preventative measures, on September 26, 1961, the Congress, by joint resolution (75 Stat. 681), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as, ""National Poison Prevention Week.""  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, do hereby proclaim March 19 through March 25, 2017, as National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguard our families from poisonous products, chemicals, and medicines found in our homes.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9579—National Agriculture Day, 2017",2017-03-21,"America's farmers and ranchers help feed the world, fuel our Nation's economy, and lead global markets in output and productivity. The efficiency of American agriculture has provided this country with abundance our ancestors could not have imagined.  The agriculture sector of the United States is endlessly innovative. It continuously builds on its centuries of progress through advances in science, research, technology, safety, production, and marketing to meet the demands of changing consumer needs and complex world markets. The agriculture sector provides jobs across our Nation, not just for farmers and ranchers, but for foresters, scientists, processors, shippers, firefighters, police, and retailers.  American agriculture is the largest positive contributor to our Nation's net trade balance, generating 10 percent of our exports and millions of American jobs. America's farmers and ranchers provide a safe and plentiful domestic food supply, which is vital to our national security. Moreover, they safeguard our sustainable resource base for future generations. As my Administration fights for better trade deals, agriculture will be an important consideration so that its significant contributions will only increase in the years ahead.  American farmers and ranchers are the heart and soul of America and they represent the determined, self-reliant character of our Nation. We are proud of American agriculture and we recognize agriculture's critical role to our Nation's bright future.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 21, 2017, as National Agriculture Day. I encourage all Americans to observe this day by recognizing the preeminent role that agriculture plays in Americans' daily life, acknowledging agriculture's continuing importance to our country's economy, and expressing our deep appreciation of farmers and ranchers across the Nation.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9580—Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy, 2017",2017-03-24,"This year marks the 196th anniversary of Greek independence. Greek and American democracy are forever intertwined. American patriots built our Republic on the ancient Greeks' groundbreaking idea that the people should decide their political fates.  As a young Nation, only recently free from Great Britain and securing its place on the world stage, America served as a source of inspiration for the revolutionary and freedom-loving Greeks who sought their own independence. Indeed, American citizens stood united with the people of Greece in its ""glorious cause"" of democracy and freedom, as expressed by Philadelphia's Franklin Gazette at the time.  The ideas and ideals of the ancient Greeks altered the course of human history, from our own American Republic to the modern Greek state and many other nations. All those who believe in the refrain ""liberty and justice for all,"" and who are devoted to democracy and rule of law, owe a debt of gratitude to Greece and the foundational principles that took root in the ancient city-state of Athens.  On this Greek Independence Day, we express our deep gratitude for Greece's enduring friendship in a region that has experienced great uncertainty. Greece is an important partner in our engagements throughout the international sphere. We look forward to strengthening our excellent bilateral defense relationship, and recognize the value and importance Greece's role as a strong ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  The American people join Greece in celebrating another milestone in its independent history, and we look forward to a future of shared success as partners and allies.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2017, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9581—Cancer Control Month, 2017",2017-03-31,"The creativity and commitment of America's incredible medical research and healthcare communities have made the United States the biomedical innovation capital of the world. In particular, American innovators have made ground-breaking advances in cancer research. These innovations help drive the declining rates of cancer mortality.  Still, much work remains to be done. Cancer is still the second-leading cause of death in the United States and causes too much suffering for too many of our families and communities.  During Cancer Control Month, we honor the memory of loved ones lost to cancer and we celebrate our cancer survivors. We recommit ourselves to developing cures for those currently battling this disease across the country and to educating people on the many ways they can prevent cancer and take care of those who have fallen ill.  Our Nation is committed to winning the fight against cancer. Throughout April, we promote methods to combat cancer and we recognize the thousands of medical professionals, public health advocates, scientific researchers, innovative companies, and family members and friends who treat, find cures for, and support those suffering from all forms of cancer.  My Administration will continue to work with the Congress to implement the 21st Century Cures Act and clear the way for enormous breakthroughs in medical science. Cutting-edge research can transform cancer treatment, so that it is more effective, less toxic, and less debilitating. Together, we will make possible the medical advances necessary to prevent, treat, and defeat this disease.  Experts believe that nearly half of the most common cancers can be prevented. Americans can reduce their risk of developing cancer through healthy eating habits, regular physical activity, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption. Regular physicals and cancer screenings and awareness of family medical histories are also critical to preventing cancers and helping those who fall victim to cancer discover it at earlier, more treatable stages.  Because of the toll cancer imposes on our citizens, families, and communities, as well as the importance of promoting prevention and early detection, my Administration wholeheartedly concurs in the request of the Congress, that dates back to 1938, to declare April as ""Cancer Control Month.""  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as Cancer Control Month. I call upon the people of the United States to speak with their doctors and healthcare providers to learn more about preventive measures that can save lives. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, the media, and other interested groups to increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent and control cancer. I also invite the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join me in recognizing Cancer Control Month.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9582—National Child Abuse Prevention Month, 2017",2017-03-31,"Childhood is precious. Growing up in a loving home, with a nurturing family, surrounded by a safe community gives our children the best opportunity to realize their full potential. Sadly, mistreatment by parents, guardians, relatives, or caregivers all too often threatens children's ability to flourish. Abuse or neglect can rob children of their sense of dignity and worth, which are indispensable to the pursuit of happiness and success in the classroom, in the workplace, and in relationships. Children rightfully impose a moral obligation on adults, who must protect them from harm and preserve their opportunity to reach their full potential and achieve their dreams. They deserve nothing less. The dreams of our children are the future of this country.  As we observe National Child Abuse Prevention Month, we renew our commitment to stop child abuse before it begins. That means preventing destructive conduct from shattering the secure and protective environments in which our children deserve to live, learn, and thrive. We must all be aware of the signs of child maltreatment and take appropriate steps to safeguard children by reporting concerns and connecting families with the help they may need.  The family is society's most important institution, and its impact on human potential is unmatched by any other influence that government, education, or even community can wield. We must promote strong families. By respecting and supporting parents, we will reduce risks and increase the safety and protection critical to our children's happiness and success. The best child abuse prevention program is a strong family with well-equipped, mature, and child-focused parents. We therefore celebrate the many community members who help parents fulfill their moral obligations by providing them a needed shoulder to lean on in troubled times.  We also honor foster and adoptive parents, child protective workers, faith leaders, community mentors, teachers, and law enforcement officials, whose tireless work every day protects children who have been tragically abused or neglected. Their often thankless service in these difficult and painful situations helps restore the safety and dignity of these wounded children and, in many cases, dramatically improves the course of their precious lives. As a Nation, we pledge to honor our commitment to protecting the vulnerable among us, not just this month, but every day of the year.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as National Child Abuse Prevention Month. I call upon all Americans to be alert to the safety and well-being of children and to support efforts that promote their physical, emotional, and developmental health.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9583—National Donate Life Month, 2017",2017-03-31,"Every day, Americans sustain the miracle of life by generously donating their organs and tissue to others in need. During National Donate Life Month, we honor the living and deceased donors who gave so others could live, and celebrate the remarkable achievements of our healthcare and science professionals who perform transplants and create techniques to make the gift of life possible.  We also continue our efforts to raise awareness of the life-saving potential Americans have as donors. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network reports that 33,606 transplants were performed during 2016, which is an 8.5 percent increase from 2015.  Still, additional donors are urgently needed. More than 118,000 people are currently waiting for organ transplants, and thousands of our family members and friends die each year waiting for matches. This month we remind Americans that people of all ages and from all walks of life can help save lives. Remarkably, one organ donor can save up to eight lives. One tissue donor can help 75 people heal. I encourage Americans everywhere to learn about how they can participate in the gift of life by becoming organ and tissue donors, and the many other ways they can give to those in need.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as National Donate Life Month. I call upon healthcare professionals, volunteers, educators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private organizations to help raise awareness of the urgent need for organ and tissue donors throughout our Nation.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9584—National Financial Capability Month, 2017",2017-03-31,"The ability of Americans to plan, save, and invest is vital to their building wealth and pursuing the American Dream. One of my first actions as President was to issue an Executive Order entitled ""Core Principles for Regulating the United States Financial System,"" and its first core principle is that financial regulation should ""empower Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices in the marketplace, save for retirement, and build individual wealth.""  Empowering Americans to make independent financial decisions and informed choices is critically important to our Nation's prosperity. Yet more than half of households today do not have 3 months of funds saved for emergency, and most families with children are not currently saving for college. In addition, a majority of working Americans worry about running out of money in retirement, and nearly a third of workers have no retirement savings at all.  We must address these challenges. Creating and implementing innovative financial education curriculums is critical. For example, the Department of Defense has made long -term financial security education opportunities available for our service members and their families. As a result, the men and women of the Armed Forces can plan a healthy financial future by seeking advice from personal financial managers and counselors.  My Administration will work with committed organizations in all sectors to improve financial education and share best practices so that all Americans—no matter their income, education, or background—have the capability to make sound financial decisions. Together, we will empower Americans to take advantage of the many opportunities they have to attain more financially secure and prosperous futures for themselves and their families.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as National Financial Capability Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by engaging in activities that improve their understanding of important financial decisions.

According to the Department of Justice, on average there are more than 300,000 instances of rape or other sexual assault that afflict our neighbors and loved ones every year. Behind these painful statistics are real people whose lives are profoundly affected, at times shattered, and who are invariably in need of our help, commitment, and protection.  As we recognize National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, we are reminded that we all share the responsibility to reduce and ultimately end sexual violence. As a Nation, we must develop meaningful strategies to eliminate these crimes, including increasing awareness of the problem in our communities, creating systems that protect vulnerable groups, and sharing successful prevention strategies.  My Administration, including the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services, will do everything in its power to protect women, children, and men from sexual violence. This includes supporting victims, preventing future abuse, and prosecuting offenders to the full extent of the law. I have already directed the Attorney General to create a task force on crime reduction and public safety. This task force will develop strategies to reduce crime and propose new legislation to fill gaps in existing laws.  Prevention means reducing the prevalence of sexual violence on our streets, in our homes, and in our schools and institutions. Recent research has demonstrated the effectiveness of changing social norms that accept or allow indifference to sexual violence. This can be done by engaging young people to step in and provide peer leadership against condoning violence, and by mobilizing men and boys as allies in preventing sexual and relationship violence. Our families, schools, and communities must encourage respect for women and children, who are the vast majority of victims, and promote healthy personal relationships. We must never give up the fight against the scourge of child pornography and its pernicious effects on both direct victims and the broader culture. We recommit ourselves this month to establishing a culture of respect and appreciation for the dignity of every human being.  There is tremendous work to be done. Together, we can and must protect our loved ones, families, campuses, and communities from the devastating and pervasive effects of sexual assault. In the face of sexual violence, we must commit to providing meaningful support and services for victims and survivors in the United States and around the world.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. I urge all Americans, families, law enforcement, health care providers, community and faith-based organizations, and private organizations to support survivors of sexual assault and work together to prevent these crimes in their communities.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9586—World Autism Awareness Day, 2017",2017-03-31,"On World Autism Awareness Day, we highlight the importance of addressing the causes and improving the treatments for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We also recognize the importance of identifying ASDs early in a child's life and of understanding the obstacles faced by people living on the autism spectrum. Together, we celebrate the many ways individuals with ASDs enhance our daily lives and make priceless contributions to our schools, workplaces, and communities.  Autism spectrum disorders affect an estimated one out of every 68 children in America. Individuals and families living with autism come from diverse backgrounds. These families face enormous challenges in assisting their loved ones over the course of their lifetimes. As those with ASDs reach early adulthood, families are often faced with even greater obstacles than during childhood, including planning for the successful transition into adulthood and independent life.  We are hopeful that our Nation's efforts will result in significant advancements related to autism diagnosis and treatments in the months and years ahead. Ongoing efforts to scan the human genome carry significant potential to better manage the disorder and, ultimately, find a cure. My Administration will continue to work with the Congress to implement the 21st Century Cures Act and help to clear the way for breakthroughs in medical science. Together, we will turn scientific discoveries into real solutions for people with complex health issues like autism.  Cutting edge therapies and lifelong treatments can impose enormous burdens and expenses on the families of people with autism spectrum disorders. I applaud the efforts by Members of Congress to enact tax-free savings vehicles for families of people with disabilities and ASDs. I also encourage the ongoing public-private efforts to develop new technologies to prevent wandering and keep individuals with ASDs safe.  For generations, men and women living on the autism spectrum have made extraordinary contributions in the fields of science, technology, art, literature, business, politics, and many other professions. Yet the world still has a great deal to learn about ASDs. We must continue our research to improve early identification and intervention, strengthen our comprehension of the disorder, and open opportunities for every member of our society to live independently and live the American Dream. My Administration is committed to promoting greater knowledge of ASDs and encouraging innovation that will lead to new treatments and cures for autism.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Sunday, April 2, 2017, as World Autism Awareness Day. I invite all Americans to Light it Up Blue, which Melania and I will do at the White House. I call upon all Americans to learn more about the signs of autism to improve early diagnosis, understand the challenges faced by those with autism spectrum disorders, and to do what they can to support individuals with autism spectrum disorders and their families.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9587—National Crime Victims' Rights Week, 2017",2017-04-03,"During National Crime Victims' Rights Week, we stand with crime victims and their families, we renew our commitment to safeguarding our communities from crime, and we recognize those who devote their lives to supporting and empowering victims and survivors.  Crime and violence rob people of their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We must focus on the plight of crime victims and search for effective solutions. For too long, communities across this Nation have suffered from murder rates that are far too high. Gang-related shootings plague our major cities, while violence continues to afflict towns both small and large.  The physical, mental, and emotional scars borne by crime victims are often coupled with serious financial implications. In 1984, President Reagan signed the Victims of Crime Act, which established the Crime Victims Fund. This fund provides compensation for victims of crime for crime-related expenses such as medical payments, counseling, lost wages, and funeral and burial costs; supports victims' service programs such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centers; and builds capacity to improve responsiveness to the needs of crime victims. The Crime Victims Fund receives billions of dollars each year from, among other sources, certain criminal fines and penalties paid by convicted Federal offenders, which helps prevent American taxpayers from shouldering the burdens of reparations. While this fund cannot completely undo the damage caused by crime, it can at least ease the monetary burden felt by victims and their families in the midst of grief.  As a society, we must continue to support those who have endured the fallout from crime. My Administration is developing an office to assist victims of crimes committed by criminal aliens. The Victims Of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE), within the Department of Homeland Security, will work to serve the victims of open borders policies—which will no longer form the basis of our immigration system. These victims will not be ignored by the media or silenced by special interests any longer. We will restore law and order and protect our citizens from this undue harm.  During National Crime Victims' Week, we renew our commitment to protecting all victims of crime, vindicating their rights, alleviating their burdens, and preventing future crime. We will assist our law enforcement community in bringing justice to victims and to their communities. My Administration is resolved to uphold this fundamental purpose of the United States Government—preserving security for all Americans.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2 through April 8, 2017, as National Crime Victims' Rights Week. I urge all Americans, families, law enforcement, community and faith-based organizations, and private organizations to work together to support victims of crime and protect their rights. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9589—Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A., 2017",2017-04-06,"At the core of the American Dream lies the belief that our futures are not pre-determined and can be improved through learning and hard work. On Education and Sharing Day, we acknowledge the critical role of families, schools, and religious and other civic institutions in nurturing in our children the values that enable them to realize the full scope of their ambitions.  Education and Sharing Day recognizes the remarkable efforts of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, to use values-based education to drive our Nation's children toward the American Dream. As an educator, Rabbi Schneerson understood that education is incomplete if it is devoid of moral development. Working through a spirit of optimism, he strived to teach children to be honest, civil, respectful of differences, and self-disciplined, in addition to being intellectually rigorous.  On April 18, 1978, our Nation's first Education Day, U.S.A., Rabbi Schneerson wrote that ""we can neither be satisfied nor slacken our efforts"" so long as ""there is still one child that does not receive an adequate education."" These words inspire us today, as they did then, to empower our children and share with each of them the opportunity and promise of America. It is up to us to support our children in realizing their hopes and to encourage them to reach their fullest potential.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 7, 2017, as ""Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A."" I call upon government officials, educators, volunteers, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9590—Pan American Day and Pan American Week, 2017",2017-04-07,"Pan American Day and Pan American Week commemorate the 127th anniversary of the conclusion of the First International Conference of American States. This inter-American gathering planted the seed for the creation of the Organization of American States, an enduring organization for the promotion of democracy, security, human rights, and economic development throughout the Americas. Pan American Day and Pan American Week remind us to reflect on the shared history of the Americas and the Caribbean and to commit to strengthening relationships with our regional partners based on common interests and shared values.  My Administration is dedicated to improving border security, dismantling transnational criminal networks, and combating terrorism to ensure the safety of our citizens. We are committed to constructive and cooperative engagement with our longstanding Pan American partners, building on existing linkages and forging new relationships, to advance these critical objectives.  The governments and people of the Americas are united through longstanding institutional, economic, cultural, and social bonds. In conversations and meetings with regional leaders, I continue to reinforce America's commitment to those bonds and to advancing the Pan American ideals of peace and prosperity across the Western Hemisphere. As these conversations continue, we will find new ways to promote enhanced, reciprocal relationships among the Pan American States, advancing the well-being of people throughout the region.  As we celebrate Pan American Day and Pan American Week, commemorating the formation of our Pan American partnership on April 14, 1890, let us reaffirm our close ties and pledge to work together on shared priorities that are vital to the interests of our countries.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 14, 2017, as Pan American Day and April 9 through April 15, 2017, as Pan American Week.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9591—National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, 2017",2017-04-07,"On National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day, America honors our service men and women imprisoned during war. These patriots have moved and inspired our Nation through their unyielding sacrifices and devout allegiance. We honor the strength through adversity of all of these heroes from our Nation's wars and conflicts, from the American Revolution to the World Wars, from Korea to Vietnam, from Desert Storm to the War on Terror.  American service members serve and fight selflessly each day to secure the freedoms we often take for granted. They bear the full weight of their oath to ""support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic,"" in which there is no safety clause. None know this so well as our former prisoners of war (POWs). According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, more than half a million Americans have been captured and interned as POWs since the American Revolution.  This year marks the 75th anniversary of the Bataan Death March. After the surrender of the Bataan peninsula in the Philippines on April 9, 1942, Filipino and American soldiers were rounded up and forced to march 60 miles from Mariveles to San Fernando. An estimated 500 Americans died during the march, as they were starved, beaten, and tortured to death. Those who reached San Fernando were taken in cramped boxcars to POW camps, where thousands more Americans died of disease and starvation.  These stories remind us of the great sacrifice and bravery of our men and women in the Armed Forces. Throughout our history, they have risked everything to defend our country. They have been stripped of liberty, and regained it. They have faced the darkness of captivity, and emerged to the warm light of freedom. These victories have no match. These triumphs ignite the flame of liberty deep within their hearts, and in ours, and make America the great Nation it is today.  But in celebrating those POWs who returned from captivity, we also solemnly remember and honor those who died in captivity. They paid the ultimate price for their love of country.  As President, I am committed to providing our veterans, and especially our former POWs, with the support, care, and resources they deserve. Our country owes a debt to our heroes that we can never adequately repay, but which we will always honor each day.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 9, 2017, as National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon Americans to observe this day by honoring the service and sacrifice of all our former prisoners of war and to express our Nation's eternal gratitude for their sacrifice. I also call upon Federal, State, and local government officials and organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9592—National Park Week, 2017",2017-04-14,"This year we celebrate National Park Week as the National Park Service begins its second century as a critical guardian of America's Federal public lands. During National Park Week, national parks across our country waive their entrance fees and welcome all explorers to experience, as past generations have, the history and splendor of our Nation's treasures.  The national park system started with a painting. In 1872, Thomas Moran painted The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, presented it to the Congress, and captivated countless Americans. Inspired by Moran's beautiful illustration and western explorers' stories, photographs, and sketches, the Congress and President Ulysses S. Grant enacted the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act. This law established Yellowstone as the world's first national park and transformed how we protect many of our Nation's landmarks.  Forty years later, President Theodore Roosevelt, known as the ""Conservation President,"" established Crater Lake, Oregon, as our fifth national park. During his presidency, Roosevelt doubled the number of national parks, designating, in addition to Crater Lake: Wind Cave, South Dakota; Sullys Hill, North Dakota; Mesa Verde, Colorado; and Platt, Oklahoma. Given his instrumental role in expanding our national park system, it is fitting that his likeness endures at Mount Rushmore National Memorial.  Today, visitors from around the world travel to our Nation's 59 national parks to climb snow-capped peaks, splash under majestic falls, rappel into the deepest canyons, and find peace in shaded forests. Our parks routinely provide visitors with unforgettable, sometimes life-changing experiences. From their unsurpassed beauty to their unmatched physical challenges, our parks capture the spirit of America's pioneering history. They symbolize our ongoing commitment to the preservation of our land and wildlife, and they set the conservation standard for the rest of the world.  It is a priority of my Administration to protect these magnificent lands, and to ensure all Americans have access to our national parks, as well as to other National Park Service sites, throughout the next century. For this reason, I chose to donate the first portion of my salary as President to the American Battlefield Protection Program, which the National Park Service uses to preserve significant American battlefields. It is my hope that we will pass down these natural and historic sites to our children and grandchildren.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 15 through April 23, 2017, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate by visiting our national parks and learning more about the natural, cultural, and historical heritage that belongs to each and every citizen of the United States of America.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9593—National Volunteer Week, 2017",2017-04-21,"During National Volunteer Week, we celebrate the spirit of compassion and generosity that drives us to care for others, and we recognize America's volunteers. Our volunteers are often unsung and unseen, but they are heroes.  One of our Nation's greatest strengths has always been our citizens' unique commitment to improving the lives of others. The principles of charitable compassion and philanthropic collaboration were at the heart of our Founding Fathers' efforts to build a culture that serves the greater good. From our earliest days, Americans have answered the call to help those in need—at home and around the world. This service, fundamental to our Nation's character, is renewed each day by citizens who generously give their time and talents to help others.  Our Nation's commitment to civic engagement continues to thrive. American volunteers keep students on track for graduation, care for seniors and veterans, and rebuild communities after terrible storms. Beyond our borders, our volunteers often place their lives at risk as they help those affected by war, poverty, and disease.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 60 million Americans volunteered in 2015, giving an estimated $185 billion in service to their communities. The latest data shows that our Nation's seniors lead the way in time spent volunteering, and we are immensely thankful for their commitment. Our busy adults aged 35 to 54 volunteer at the highest rates, and our communities depend on their continued involvement. Our Nation continues to build a culture of service—the volunteer rate among our teenagers has steadily climbed over the past several years.  This week we pay tribute to the extraordinary faith-based, nonprofit, national service, service club, military service, and community organizations that provide volunteers with opportunities to serve. These organizations engage and connect Americans from every walk of life. Through the generosity of our citizens, we are reminded that each one of us has a role to play in improving our communities. During the recent International Week of Service, service organizations across the globe came together to assist others and make an impact. This effort is a shining example of how our Nation's generous volunteers continue to lead the world in helping those most in need.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 23 through April 29, 2017, as National Volunteer Week.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9594—Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, 2017",2017-04-24,"On Yom HaShoah—the day of Holocaust Remembrance—and during this Week of Remembrance, we honor the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution.  The Holocaust was the state-sponsored, systematic persecution and attempted annihilation of European Jewry by the Nazi regime and its collaborators. By the end of World War II, six million Jews had been brutally slaughtered. The Nazis also targeted other groups for persecution and murder, including Roma (Gypsies), persons with mental and physical disabilities, Soviet prisoners of war, Jehovah's Witnesses, Slavs and other peoples of Europe, gays, and political opponents.  The United States stands shoulder to shoulder with the survivors of the Holocaust, their families, and the descendants of those who were murdered. We support the Jewish diaspora and the State of Israel as we fulfill our duty to remember the victims, honor their memory and their lives, and celebrate humanity's victory over tyranny and evil. Holocaust survivors, despite scars from history's darkest days, continue to inspire us to remember the past and learn from its lessons. By sharing their experiences and wisdom, they continue to fuel our resolve to advance human rights and to combat antisemitism and other forms of hatred.  During this week in 1945, American and Allied forces liberated the concentration camp at Dachau and other Nazi death camps, laying bare to the world the unconscionable horror of the Holocaust. We must remain vigilant against hateful ideologies and indifference. Every generation must learn and apply the lessons of the Holocaust so that such horror, atrocity, and genocide never again occur. It is our solemn obligation to reaffirm our commitment to respecting the fundamental freedoms and inherent dignity of every human being.  Let us join together to remember and honor the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution. We express our eternal gratitude to the liberators who selflessly risked their lives to save those of others, and we pledge to never be bystanders to evil.  We must never forget.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby ask the people of the United States to observe the Days of Remembrance of Victims of the Holocaust, April 23 through April 30, 2017, and the solemn anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camps, with appropriate study, prayers and commemoration, and to honor the memory of the victims of the Holocaust and Nazi persecution by internalizing the lessons of this atrocity so that it is never repeated.

"Donald J.

Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have distinguished themselves in the arts, literature, and sports. They are leading researchers in science, medicine, and technology; dedicated teachers to our Nation's children; innovative farmers and ranchers; and distinguished lawyers and government leaders.  Dr. Sammy Lee, a Korean American who passed away last December, exemplified the spirit of this month. Dr. Lee was the first Asian American man to win an Olympic gold medal, becoming a platform diving champion at the 1948 London Olympics only 1 year after graduating from medical school. To fulfill his dreams, Dr. Lee overcame several obstacles, including his local childhood pool's policy of opening to minorities only once per week. Later in life he was subject to housing discrimination (even after 8 years of military service). Dr. Lee nevertheless tirelessly served his country and community, including by representing the United States at the Olympic Games, on behalf of several Presidents.  Katherine Sui Fun Cheung also embodied the spirit of this month. In 1932, she became the first Chinese American woman to earn a pilot license. At the time, only about 1 percent of pilots in the United States were women. As a member of The Ninety-Nines, an organization of women pilots, she paved the way for thousands of women to take to the skies.  There are more than 20 million Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States. Each day, through their actions, they make America more vibrant, more prosperous, and more secure. Our Nation is particularly grateful to the many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who have served and are currently serving in our Armed Forces, protecting the Nation, and promoting freedom and peace around the world.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017 as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. The Congress, by Public Law 102-450, as amended, has also designated the month of May each year as ""Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month."" I encourage all Americans to learn more about our Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander heritage, and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9596—Jewish American Heritage Month, 2017",2017-04-28,"During Jewish American Heritage Month, we celebrate our Nation's strong American Jewish heritage, rooted in the ancient faith and traditions of the Jewish people. The small band of Dutch Jews who first immigrated in 1654, seeking refuge and religious liberty, brought with them their families, their religion, and their cherished customs, which they have passed on from generation to generation. The moral and ethical code of the Jewish people is inspired by their spiritual vocation of ""tikkun olam""—the charge to repair the world. Through that vocation, the Jewish people have left an indelible mark on American culture. Today, it is manifested in the towering success Jewish people have achieved in America through a unique synthesis of respect for heritage and love of country.  Escaping religious persecution and ethnic violence and seeking political freedom and economic opportunity, American Jews, over centuries, have held firm in the belief that the United States was ""Di Goldene Medina""—the Golden Country. Those who moved here built houses and gardens, raised families, and launched businesses. They have pursued education to advance their mission to make the world a better place. In every aspect of the country's cultural, spiritual, economic, and civic life, American Jews have stood at the forefront of the struggles for human freedom, equality, and dignity, helping to shine a light of hope to people around the globe.  The achievements of American Jews are felt throughout American society and culture, in every field and in every profession. American Jews have built institutions of higher learning, hospitals, and manifold cultural and philanthropic organizations. American Jews have even brought us our greatest superheroes—Captain America, Superman, and Batman. American Jews have composed some of our defining national hymns like God Bless America, timeless musicals like The Sound of Music, and even famous Christmas songs. From Admiral Hyman G. Rickover to Albert Einstein, Richard Rodgers to Irving Berlin, Jerry Siegel to Bill Finger, Mel Brooks to Don Rickles, and Levi Strauss to Elie Wiesel, American Jews have transformed all aspects of American life and continue to enrich the American spirit.  This month, I celebrate with my family—including my daughter, Ivanka, my son-in-law, Jared, my grandchildren, and our extended family—the deep spiritual connection that binds, and will always bind, the Jewish people to the United States and its founding principles. We recognize the faith and optimism exemplified by American Jews is what truly makes America ""The Golden Country,"" and we express our Nation's gratitude for this great, strong, prosperous, and loving people.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017 as Jewish American Heritage Month.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9597—National Foster Care Month, 2017",2017-04-28,"During the month of May, we observe National Foster Care Month and we celebrate those who have opened their homes and their hearts to children in need and those who have devoted their careers to serving America's foster youth.  Americans throughout the country are serving their communities as foster parents, mentors, respite care providers, and volunteers. In the last year alone, America's foster families opened their homes and hearts to more than 300,000 young people.  But we can do more. Every child deserves a safe and supportive family. Ensuring that children grow up with the opportunity to reach their full potential is a top priority of my Administration. For thousands of children whose biological families are unable to support them, foster families provide a secure and nurturing environment that is essential for a successful start in life.  Foster families serve young people from all walks of life, from infants awaiting adoption, to children seeking reunification with their families and teens in need of safe havens from negative influences. In many cases, they offer our Nation's most at-risk children a second chance at the American Dream.  A tremendous demand exists for foster parents and families across the country. Together as a Nation, we must raise awareness about this need and inspire volunteers to step forward and invest in the lives of our Nation's youth through our foster care system.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017 as National Foster Care Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month by taking time to help children and youth in foster care and to recognize the commitment of those who touch their lives, particularly celebrating their foster parents and other caregivers.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9598—National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, 2017",2017-04-28,"A Proclamation  During National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, we remind Americans of all ages and backgrounds that maintaining a healthy and active lifestyle is critical to long-term physical and mental well-being, productivity, and quality of life. We also highlight the close relationship between sports and physical fitness and the benefits related to participation in sports, including disease prevention, lessons in teamwork and leadership, and the practice of overcoming adversity. In addition to their physical health benefits, sports promote positive mentoring, discipline, and structure for young Americans.  In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower formed the President's Council on Youth Fitness, demonstrating a national commitment to improving health and physical fitness. President Eisenhower's legacy lives on today in the form of the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, which advises me on health and fitness and engages with communities across the country to improve youth fitness and empower Americans to adopt healthy lifestyles that include regular physical activity and good nutrition. My Administration will continue this tradition, with a particular focus on promoting sports and physical fitness among our youth.  As we each work to maintain our own physical fitness, we play a part in building a stronger and healthier America. Failure to engage in physical activity contributes to serious negative health outcomes, including obesity and diseases such as type 2 diabetes, and an increased risk of heart disease, the number one cause of death in America. Complications from these health problems often impact quality of life and frequently lead to other related and debilitating conditions.  As we celebrate National Physical Fitness and Sports Month, let us commit ourselves to celebrating active lifestyles, promoting physical fitness, and tackling public health issues together by making healthier choices. Let us rededicate ourselves each day to childhood obesity prevention, and recognize the role that sports can play in our Nation's health and well-being. Throughout May, I encourage all Americans to eat nutritious food, to take more time each day to be active, and to inspire friends, family, peers, and loved ones to do the same.  Finally, the Americans who serve our Nation's youth through sports and other physical activities deserve our collective appreciation. Whether through coaching, driving kids to and from practice, or organizing the leagues and events that make sport competitions possible, these Americans make countless unseen sacrifices that merit special recognition.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017, as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month. I call upon the people of the United States to make physical activity and sports participation a priority in their lives.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9599—Older Americans Month, 2017",2017-04-28,"Older Americans are our Nation's memory. Some of today's grandparents and great-grandparents were born during the Great Depression, lived through the Second World War, witnessed the rise and fall of Communism, fought in Korea and Vietnam, marched with Martin Luther King, Jr., and watched the first man walk on the Moon. Now, they surf the internet and share family photos on their phones in a world that is richer and freer than the one into which they were born. Listening to the stories of our older citizens allows younger Americans to appreciate the country they inherited and gain the wisdom necessary to make it even better for their children and grandchildren.  As we celebrate Older Americans Month, we take the opportunity to thank our seniors and recognize the enormous contributions they make to the Nation. Indeed, one of modern life's greatest blessings are the medical advancements that make it possible for older people to remain healthy and active well into the later stages of life. We are blessed to have their presence, their love, and their unmatched perspective for our families.  Our elders also have an unprecedented opportunity to make a difference in our communities by sharing their talents, wisdom, and time. America's seniors give back in a myriad of ways, working with children in our schools, providing assistance to the sick and shut-in, and inventing new and innovative products. They have made our Nation stronger through their experience, knowledge, and willingness to share with others.  Finally, during this month we also recognize that, as we age, many of us will need more assistance from our friends and family. We therefore recommit ourselves to ensuring that older Americans are not neglected or abused, receive the best healthcare available, live in suitable homes, have adequate income and economic opportunities, and enjoy freedom and independence in their golden years. They deserve and we owe them nothing less.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017 as Older Americans Month. I call upon all Americans to honor our elders, acknowledge their contributions, care for those in need, and reaffirm our country's commitment to older Americans this month and throughout the year.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9600—National Charter Schools Week, 2017",2017-04-28,"During National Charter Schools Week, we recommit ourselves to empowering students and giving parents their rightful freedom over their children's education. We recognize the successful public charter schools across the country and the families, teachers, administrators, and communities who continue to invest in our Nation's most precious resource our children.  More than 25 years ago, an idea took root: educators free of restrictive processes and policies, and empowered to experiment with new teaching methods, would generate better outcomes for students. Charter schools are built around this idea. Like traditional public schools, they are tuition-free, but they operate independently from traditional school boards and, in exchange, are held accountable by local authorizers to standards that are often more demanding.  Education is the foundation for success, and educational opportunity should not be limited or defined by status, income, or residence. All children deserve access to a quality education. When our children receive a rigorous education and are held to high standards, they can achieve their goals, rise out of poverty, and actively engage in our democracy.  For too long, however, students across this country have been trapped in failing or underperforming schools simply because of their zip code. The Washington one-size-fits-all approach has not worked for far too many of our children. Fortunately, we have seen how allowing families the freedom to choose other schooling options including charter schools delivers life-changing results.  Today, 44 States and the District of Columbia have laws that allow for charter schools, which enroll more than 3 million students. The demand for charter schools only continues to grow: a recent study showed that at least 70 percent of parents favor opening a charter school in their neighborhood. This is because charter schools work. According to Stanford University's Center for Research on Education Outcomes study, students in urban charter schools, on average, achieve significantly greater outcomes in both reading and math. This is why I have called upon the Congress to increase funding for charter schools as well as school choice programs for disadvantaged youth, which would include millions of African American and Latino children. Under the leadership of Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, we will expand charter school options for students throughout the United States.  As Americans, we have an abiding conviction that our next generation's future should be even brighter than ours. Education provides the staircase out of poverty, toward a fulfilling life of work and service, and a true shot at the American Dream. We want every student from New Orleans to Kansas City, from Houston to Detroit, and every city and town in between to rise to success. Charter schools have tremendous potential to offer students around the country the priceless gift of possibility. As a Nation, we should support the continued success of charter schools and hold our students up to the high standards they are all capable of achieving. Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 30 through May 6, 2017, as National Charter Schools Week. I commend our Nation's successful public charter schools, teachers, and administrators, and I call on States and communities to empower parents and families by supporting high-quality charter schools as an important school choice option.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9601—Small Business Week, 2017",2017-04-28,"During Small Business Week, we celebrate our Nation's small business owners, whose entrepreneurship and hard work bring jobs and prosperity to our communities. Small business owners embody the American pioneering spirit and remind us that determination can turn aspiration into achievement. This week, we affirm our commitment to removing government barriers to the success of American small businesses.  Small businesses are an economic force in this country, and have grown by nearly 40 percent since 1982 despite often facing regulatory headwinds. They employ almost 58 million Americans, accounting for about 50 percent of all private-sector jobs in the United States. Our communities depend on the success of small businesses. More than 99 percent of all employer firms in the country are small businesses and in recent years, too many of them have been crushed by overwhelming Federal regulations. At the beginning of my Administration, I met with small business owners who continue to struggle under too many burdensome regulations. I have already signed legislation disapproving many excessive and unreasonable regulations and issued several Executive Orders to address other overreaching rules. These actions will free our Nation's entrepreneurs to spend more time creating jobs and less time navigating the Federal bureaucracy.  My Administration is also working to ensure our Nation's trade deals establish favorable conditions for small businesses to export their goods and services. With a level playing field on the international stage, America's small businesses will lead an export revival that brings jobs and wealth back to our country.  Our Nation also deserves a tax system that works for not against small business owners. One of the biggest problems facing our small businesses is an unduly complicated, and often unfair, tax system. Tax reform will unleash a new wave of investment, innovation, and entrepreneurship in our country. Americans will keep more money in their pockets, leaving them with the resources they need to expand their businesses and hire more workers.  America's small business owners transform ideas into reality. They are a strong testament to the opportunities a market economy affords. During this week, we recognize the incredible contributions small businesses make to our country and pledge to foster the conditions that enable them to prosper and thrive.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 30 through May 6, 2017, as Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize the critical contributions of America's entrepreneurs and small business owners as they grow our Nation's economy.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9602—Loyalty Day, 2017",2017-04-28,"On Loyalty Day, we recognize and reaffirm our allegiance to the principles upon which our Nation is built. We pledge our dedication to the United States of America and honor its unique heritage, reminding ourselves that we are one Nation, under God, made possible by those who have sacrificed to defend our liberty. We honor our Republic and acknowledge the great responsibility that self-governance demands of each of us.  The United States stands as the world's leader in upholding the ideals of freedom, equality, and justice. Together, and with these fundamental concepts enshrined in our Constitution, our Nation perseveres in the face of those who would seek to harm it.  As one Nation, we will always stand strong against the threats of terrorism and lawlessness. The loyalty of our citizenry sends a clear signal to our allies and enemies that the United States will never yield from our way of life. Through the Department of Defense and other national security agencies, we are working to destroy ISIS, and to secure for all Americans the liberty terrorists seek to extinguish. We humbly thank our brave service members and veterans who have worn our Nation's uniform—from the American Revolution to the present day. Their unwavering loyalty and fidelity has made the world a safer, more free, and more just place. We are inspired by their pride in our country's principles, their devotion to our freedom, and their solemn pledge to protect and defend our Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  To express our country's loyalty to individual liberties, to limited government, and to the inherent dignity of every human being, the Congress, by Public Law 85-529 as amended, has designated May 1 of each year as ""Loyalty Day."" On this day, we honor the United States of America and those who uphold its values, particularly those who have fought and continue to fight to defend the freedom it affords us.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2017, as Loyalty Day. This Loyalty Day, I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies in our schools and other public places, including recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America. I also call upon all Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings and grounds on that day.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9603—National Mental Health Awareness Month, 2017",2017-05-01,"National Mental Health Awareness Month is a time to recognize the millions of American families affected by mental illness and to redouble our efforts to ensure that those who are suffering get the care and treatment they need. Nearly 10 million Americans suffer from a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression. Unfortunately, approximately 60 percent of adults and 50 percent of adolescents with mental illness do not get the treatment or other services they need. As a result, instead of receiving ongoing expert psychiatric care, these individuals often find themselves in emergency rooms, prisons, or living on the streets.  This month, and for the course of my Administration, I am committed to working with the Department of Health and Human Services, States, and communities throughout the country to find a better answer for the millions of Americans who need mental health services and their families. We must further empower States, law enforcement, first responders, doctors, and families to help those with the most severe mental illnesses; to ensure that people with mental illness have access to evidence-based treatment and services; and to fight the stigma associated with mental illness, which can prevent people from seeking care. We must also resolve to enhance our understanding of mental illness and its relationship to other complex societal challenges, including homelessness, substance abuse, and suicide; and we reaffirm our commitment to improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment through innovative medical strategies.  Addressing substance abuse, addiction, and overdose is often critical to improving mental health outcomes. An estimated 8.1 million adults in America suffering with a mental illness also struggle with substance abuse. Many of those who struggled with both were among the 52,000 people in our country who died from a drug overdose in 2015. Approximately 44,000 Americans took their own lives in the past year, a preventable tragedy that frequently correlates with mental illness and substance abuse.  On May 4, 2017, my Administration, along with more than 160 organizations and 1,100 communities, will commemorate National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day. At this national event, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price will give special recognition awards to Awareness Day Honorary Chairpersons and United States Olympic champions Michael Phelps and Allison Schmitt for speaking openly about their behavioral health challenges and for encouraging young Americans to lead healthy lives. The event will help promote the importance of National Mental Health Awareness Month, providing Americans with resources related to treatment and services for mental health and substance abuse.  No American should suffer in silence and solitude. During Mental Health Awareness Month, I encourage all Americans to seek to better understand mental illness and to look for opportunities to help those with mental health issues. We must support those in need and remain committed to hope and healing. Through compassion and committed action, we will enrich the spirit of the American people and improve the well-being of our Nation. Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017 as National Mental Health Awareness Month. I call upon all Americans to support citizens suffering from mental illness, raise awareness of mental health conditions through appropriate programs and activities, and commit our Nation to innovative prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9604—Law Day, U.S.A., 2017",2017-05-01,"Today, we celebrate Law Day, as we have since President Dwight D. Eisenhower first commemorated it in 1958, and reflect upon our great heritage of liberty, justice, and equality. Our Founders risked their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor in defense of these values. More than 240 years ago, they set pen to paper and declared to the world ""that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" The Declaration of Independence thus set our Nation on its revolutionary and transformative path to protecting people's inherent, individual rights and liberties from the tyranny of an elite few who might use the powers of the state to trample upon them.  To protect the values for which they fought, the Framers of our Constitution created a government of limited and separated powers that enables the rule of law to prevail over the whims of government officials. As the great Justice Antonin Scalia frequently observed, every dictatorship has a bill of rights, but paper rights alone will not preserve liberty. It is our Constitution's clear division of the sovereign's power—vesting the power to create laws in the Congress, the power to execute laws in the President, and the power to interpret laws in an independent judiciary—that enables us to remain free and in control of our government.  Recognizing, as President Ronald Reagan did, that ""freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction,"" today we pay tribute to the government of laws, and not of men, that forms the foundation of our freedom. Therefore, on this Law Day, we rededicate ourselves to the rule of law, to the separation of powers, and, in the words of President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, to the preservation of ""government of the people, by the people, for the people.""  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, in accordance with Public Law 87-20, as amended, do hereby proclaim May 1, 2017, as Law Day, U.S.A. I urge all Americans, including government officials, to observe this day by reflecting upon the importance of the rule of law in our Nation and displaying the flag of the United States in support of this national observance.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9605—National Day of Prayer, 2017",2017-05-04,"We come together on our National Day of Prayer as one Nation, under God, to show gratitude for our many blessings, to give thanks for His providence, and to ask for His continued wisdom, strength, and protection as we chart a course for the future. We are united in prayer, each according to our own faith and tradition, and we believe that in America, people of all faiths, creeds, and religions must be free to exercise their natural right to worship according to their consciences.  We are also reminded and reaffirm that all human beings have the right, not only to pray and worship according to their consciences, but to practice their faith in their homes, schools, charities, and businesses—in private and in the public square—free from government coercion, discrimination, or persecution. Religion is not merely an intellectual exercise, but also a practical one that demands action in the world. Even the many prisoners around the world who are persecuted for their faith can pray privately in their cells. But our Constitution demands more: the freedom to practice one's faith publicly.  The religious liberty guaranteed by the Constitution is not a favor from the government, but a natural right bestowed by God. Our Constitution and our laws that protect religious freedom merely recognize the right that all people have by virtue of their humanity. As Thomas Jefferson wisely questioned: ""can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God?""  In 1789, President George Washington proclaimed a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, calling upon Americans to ""unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations."" In 1988, the Congress, by Public Law 100-307, called on the President to issue each year a proclamation designating the first Thursday in May as a ""National Day of Prayer."" On this National Day of Prayer, the right to pray freely and live according to one's faith is under threat around the world from coercive governments and terrorist organizations. We therefore pray especially for the many people around the world who are persecuted for their beliefs and deprived of their fundamental liberty to live according to their conscience. We pray for the triumph of freedom over oppression, and for God's love and mercy over evil.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 4, 2017, as a National Day of Prayer. I invite the citizens of our Nation to pray, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, in thanksgiving for the freedoms and blessings we have received, and for God's guidance and continued protection as we meet the challenges before us.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9606—National Hurricane Preparedness Week, 2017",2017-05-05,"National Hurricane Preparedness Week reminds those of us living in hurricane-prone areas of the need to ready our homes, communities, and families for extreme weather events before hurricane season arrives. Preparing for weather-related disasters can dramatically reduce their impact on you, your family, and your community.  The 2017 hurricane season, which begins June 1 and lasts through November 30, marks the 25th anniversaries of Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew tore through South Florida before making landfall, again, in Louisiana. It claimed 65 lives, destroyed 25,000 homes, and caused approximately $26 billion in overall damage. A few weeks later, Hurricane Iniki struck the Hawaiian Island of Kauai, killing six, demolishing 1,400 homes, and causing about $1.8 billion in overall damage. The tragic losses caused by those terrible storms remind us of the need to prepare for the destruction hurricanes can bring.  As Hurricane Andrew demonstrated, inland areas are not immune from the destruction hurricanes can bring with them through flooding rains and other related weather events. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration study of Hurricane Andrew revealed that most of the damage it caused was inland from the primary storm surge areas. Just last year, heavy rains from Hurricane Matthew caused destructive flooding and loss of life in the Carolinas, even though the hurricane's eye remained mostly offshore.  This week, through several initiatives, I am encouraging Americans to take the time to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season. After a major disaster, you may not have immediate access to the services you are accustomed to, such as clean water, grocery stores, and emergency services. Hurricane preparedness information provided by the National Weather Service (NWS) and the Ready campaign conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), both available online, outline important steps you can take right now to safeguard your family, pets, and property. These resources will help you create evacuation and communications plans and assemble a disaster kit of necessary supplies. Developing and implementing these plans will save lives and avoid excess damage.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 7 through May 13, 2017, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon Americans living in hurricane-prone areas to observe this week by making use of the online resources provided by the NWS and FEMA and by taking actions to safeguard their families, homes, and businesses from the dangers of hurricanes. I also call upon Federal, State, local, tribal, and territorial emergency management officials to help inform our communities about hurricane preparedness and response, in order to help prevent storm damage and save lives.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9607—Public Service Recognition Week, 2017",2017-05-05,"During Public Service Recognition Week, we express gratitude for our civil servants. Their daily effort keeps our Government functioning and helps make our Nation exceptional.  Throughout my first 100 days, I have seen the tremendous work civil servants do to fulfill our duty to the American people. At all levels of government, our public servants put our country and our people first. The hard work of our mail carriers, teachers, firefighters, transit workers, and many more, creates an environment that allows individuals and companies to thrive.  To empower our civil servants to best help others, the Government must always operate more efficiently and more securely. In March, I issued an Executive Order on a Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch. I am counting on our civil servants to seize upon that order and make our Government dramatically more accountable, effective, and efficient, by going beyond the modernization efforts of the past and re-examining the operational core of our executive departments and agencies. Together, through these and other efforts, we will fulfill our responsibilities to make our Government work better for the American people.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 7 through May 13, 2017, as Public Service Recognition Week.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9608—Military Spouse Day, 2017",2017-05-12,"On Military Spouse Day, we honor military spouses for their invaluable contributions to the defense of this great Nation. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan first recognized this day with a proclamation, honoring the exemplary service and immeasurable sacrifices of our Nation's military spouses. This long overdue tribute gives thanks to those who, since the formation of our Republic, have served our country with selfless support. Military spouses have been, and continue to be, a steady, strong presence on the home front and in the hearts of our military men and women.  Most military spouses hold no rank and wear no uniform, yet humbly serve our Nation with distinction. They endure deployments for weeks, months, and years at a time, sometimes with little warning, and they must brace themselves for the uncertainty that comes with goodbye. When duty calls, they shoulder the full day-to-day responsibilities of managing a household and often of parenting—many times with little or no support. They face frequent relocations, which interrupt their careers and educational pursuits and require them to leave churches, homes, and friends. Most difficult of all, military spouses live with constant worry about the daily risks our military forces take for our country. Military spouses navigate these and other challenges with uncommon grace and inspiring strength.  My Administration will focus on supporting and increasing opportunities for military spouses. I urge American businesses to create opportunities for hiring, training, and promoting military spouses, and to identify ways to keep them employed following relocations. These women and men have skills and experiences valued by employers and coworkers alike. They give so much of themselves to our country, and they deserve our enduring respect and appreciation in return. I have pledged to our Armed Forces to have their backs, and that means providing for our military spouses as well.  On this Military Spouse Day, we recognize the exceptional women and men who have shared their loved ones with our country. We honor them for their service, praise them for their sacrifices, and offer them our gratitude and prayers on behalf of a grateful Nation.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 12, 2017, as Military Spouse Day. I call upon the people of the United States to honor military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9609—Mother's Day, 2017",2017-05-12,"Mother's Day is a special celebration in America. It is an occasion to thank our mothers for the life and love they have given us and to emphasize our affection for them, affection they deserve every day of the year. But it is also an opportunity to honor mothers across our Nation and celebrate motherhood as a pillar of our country's stability and success.  Our deep appreciation for the strength and spirit of mothers and their resolve to do what is right for their children and families cannot be overstated. They are often the first to lend a hand during hard times and the first to celebrate our proudest victories. The boundless energy of our mothers inspires us to be people of action, people who strive relentlessly toward our goals. Above all, they teach us the power and joy of unconditional love.  Today and every day, we honor the incredible women whose influence on the world is beyond measure. They brighten America's future by shaping the character of each new generation. They lead us through our deepest lessons about perseverance and hard work, preparing us for life's responsibilities. Whether by birth, adoption, or foster care, our Nation's mothers give selflessly of themselves for the well-being of the lives and futures of others. We humbly thank them for this greatest gift.  In recognition of the contributions of mothers to American families and to our Nation, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May each year as Mother's Day and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 14, 2017, as Mother's Day. I encourage all Americans to express their love and respect for their mothers or beloved mother figures, whether with us in person or in spirit, and to reflect on the importance of motherhood to the prosperity of our families, communities, and Nation.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9610—National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, 2017",2017-05-12,"During National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week, we celebrate our Nation's land, air, and sea infrastructure systems. These critical systems connect Americans to one another, provide vital national security capabilities, and serve as a cornerstone of our economy. We also recognize the transportation professionals who are dedicated to keeping our Nation's transportation networks secure, efficient, and reliable.  Quality infrastructure provides Americans with the freedom they need and deserve to move themselves and their families, and the vast array of products they want to buy and sell. But in too many cases, our roads, waterways, bridges, airports, and mass transit systems have fallen into disrepair. That is why my Administration is committed to rebuilding a world-class transportation infrastructure that works for all Americans.  Revitalizing our infrastructure is all the more important because American transportation enhancements have played and will continue to play a critical role in our national defense. During World War II, our ability to refuel ships at sea was, in the words of Admiral Chester Nimitz, the ""Navy's secret weapon."" Today, our military logistics system is essential to the defense of our homeland and our ability to project power around the world.  To remain effective, the transportation industry must constantly innovate. That is why, in addition to rebuilding our current infrastructure, my Administration is removing regulatory hurdles that have, for too long, impeded necessary infrastructure improvements. This will allow creative companies to transform how we use our roads, waterways, rails, and the skies, making them both safer for travelers and more effective for our national security.  To recognize the men and women who work in the transportation industry and who contribute to our Nation's well-being and defense, the Congress, by joint resolution approved May 16, 1957, as amended (36 U.S.C. 120), has designated the third Friday in May of each year as ""National Defense Transportation Day,"" and, by joint resolution approved May 14, 1962, as amended (36 U.S.C. 133), has declared that the week during which that Friday falls be designated as ""National Transportation Week.""  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, May 19, 2017, as National Defense Transportation Day and May 14 through May 20, 2017, as National Transportation Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate these observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities to learn more about how our transportation system contributes to the security of our citizens and the prosperity of our Nation.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9611—Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, 2017",2017-05-15,"During Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week, we honor the men and women of law enforcement who have been killed or disabled in the course of serving our communities. Police officers are the thin blue line whose sacrifices protect and serve us every day, and we pledge to support them as they risk their lives to safeguard ours.  Last year, 118 officers died in the line of duty, and of those, 66 were victims of malicious attacks. These attacks increased by nearly 40 percent from 2015. This must end. That is why one of my first actions was to direct the Department of Justice to develop a strategy to better prevent and prosecute crimes of violence against our Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers.  In addition, my Administration will continue to further the efforts of the Department of Justice to improve the lives of law enforcement officers and their families. This includes supporting the Officer Safety and Wellness Group, which improves officer safety on the job, and accelerating the processing of benefits through the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program, which provides vital resources to the families of fallen officers.  Our liberties depend on the rule of law, and that means supporting the incredible men and women of law enforcement. By a joint resolution approved October 1, 1962, as amended (76 Stat. 676), and by Public Law 103-322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136 and 137), the President has been authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as ""Peace Officers Memorial Day"" and the week in which it falls as ""Police Week.""  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 15, 2017, as Peace Officers Memorial Day and May 14 through May 20, 2017, as Police Week. In humble appreciation of our hard-working law enforcement officers, Melania and I will light the White House in blue on May 15. I call upon all Americans to observe Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I also call on the Governors of the States and Territories and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff on Peace Officers Memorial Day. I further encourage all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses on that day.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9612—Emergency Medical Services Week, 2017",2017-05-19,"During Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Week, we express our gratitude for the hundreds of thousands of skilled personnel who help save lives in communities across the United States each year. Through the hard work and dedication of these career and volunteer first responders, Americans receive the finest emergency medical treatment in their most vulnerable moments. We also honor those EMS providers who have made the ultimate sacrifice and given their lives in the line of duty.  Day or night, in every city, suburb, rural community, or wilderness area, our Nation relies upon EMS providers to respond to every kind of emergency situation to save lives and reduce suffering. In January, when more than 70 tornadoes touched down in Georgia and Mississippi, injuring many, EMS responders were there to help. In March, when wildfires threatened Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas, taking lives and forcing thousands from their homes, our EMS personnel were there providing urgent medical care and patient transportation. Last month, when flooding and tornadoes ravaged Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas, EMS personnel once more came to their neighbors' aid. Whether they are assisting during natural disasters or providing lifesaving care after car accidents, heart attacks, sports injuries, or violent crime, EMS personnel respond to tens of millions of requests for help each year in our country. We rest easier knowing that they stand ready to answer the call.  Over the past 50 years, our Nation's EMS system has evolved with ever-developing medical, transportation, and communications technologies to meet the changing needs of our communities. The EMS Agenda 2050 project—a joint effort by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, and the EMS community—will help develop a vision for meeting our communities' future emergency medical services needs and improve the health of all Americans. We commend these efforts to develop innovative new treatments, advance and adapt medical skills, establish stronger professional standards, and promote public education and health. This week, we thank our EMS professionals for their sustained commitment to excellence and dedication to service, and share our hopes for a bright future that will make us all safer and healthier.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2017, as Emergency Medical Services Week. I encourage all Americans to observe this occasion by showing their support for local EMS professionals through appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9613—National Safe Boating Week, 2017",2017-05-19,"As Memorial Day approaches and our summer season arrives, it is important for Americans of all ages to learn about safety on the water. During National Safe Boating Week, the U.S. Coast Guard and its Federal, State, and local safe boating partners encourage all boaters to explore and enjoy America's beautiful waters responsibly.  Safe boating begins with preparation. The Coast Guard estimates that human error accounts for 70 percent of all boating accidents and that life jackets could prevent more than 80 percent of boating fatalities. Through basic boating safety procedures—carrying lifesaving emergency distress and communications equipment, wearing life jackets, attending safe boating courses, participating in free boat safety checks, and staying sober when navigating—we can help ensure boaters on America's coastal, inland, and offshore waters stay safe throughout the season.  America's diverse waterways are waiting to be explored. But before enjoying a day on the water, Americans should take time this week to familiarize themselves with safe boating practices so that everyone makes it home unharmed.  In recognition of the importance of safe boating practices, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 131), as amended, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim annually the 7-day period before Memorial Day weekend as ""National Safe Boating Week.""  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2017, as National Safe Boating Week. I encourage all Americans who participate in boating activities to observe this occasion by learning more about safe boating practices and taking advantage of boating safety education opportunities. I also encourage the Governors of the States and Territories, and appropriate officials of all units of government, to join me in encouraging boating safety through events and activities.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9614—World Trade Week, 2017",2017-05-19,"Robust trade is critical to the economic strength of our country. During World Trade Week, we recognize the power of open markets around the world and celebrate the many benefits that fair international commerce can bring to our Nation. We also highlight the importance of expanded trade to our economic growth, and we commit to breaking down trade barriers and opening new markets for American exports.  Open, fair, and competitive markets increase opportunities for American workers and employers and contribute to a higher standard of living. Job creation with increased wages is a top priority of my Administration, and increasing trade—while reducing our trade deficit—is a key component of that mission. We will promote our economic growth by strengthening our manufacturing base and expanding exports in manufacturing, agriculture, and the service industries. We will also challenge unfair trade practices that leave American workers, farmers, and businesses competing in global markets at a disadvantage.  Trade has a large role in the United States economy today, but it can be even greater. Our exports contribute $2.2 trillion, or 12 percent, to our national income, supporting 11.5 million private-sector jobs. Manufacturing exports total $1.265 trillion, behind only China and Germany. The United States leads the world in both agricultural exports, which currently total $139 billion, and services exports, at $750 billion today. The United States, however, has a large and persistent trade deficit in manufacturing, overall as well as with certain trading partners. Through an increased commitment to opening markets, reducing barriers to our goods, and firmly addressing unfair trade practices, we can do far better for American workers and manufacturers.  My Administration will negotiate future trade agreements that ensure that all Americans reap the benefits of global commerce. This includes small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy. While past agreements have not always accounted for the consequential effects of trade on small businesses and the American workforce, future agreements will.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 21 through May 27, 2017, as World Trade Week. I encourage Americans to observe this week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate the benefits of trade to our country.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9615—Armed Forces Day, 2017",2017-05-19,"For almost 70 years, our Nation has set aside one day to recognize the great debt we owe to the men and women who serve in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. On Armed Forces Day, we salute the bravery of those who defend our Nation's peace and security. Their service defends for Americans the freedom that all people deserve.  This year, we also reflect on the 100th anniversary of our Nation's entry into World War I. More than 4.7 million Americans would ultimately serve in the United States Armed Forces during that terrible conflict. Their sacrifice has not been forgotten. One hundred years later, we face different threats and challenges. But our safety and security, and the defense of our way of life, rest in the same able hands of our Armed Forces.  Because our Armed Forces must constantly adapt to new threats, our Nation is committed to ensuring they have the tools and resources they need as they train, deploy, and fight in defense of our country and defending our values. This is why my budget calls for a $54 billion increase in national defense spending.  Today, we salute our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen for their dedication as they carry out the extraordinary duty of protecting our country. We also pay tribute to the families who serve alongside them, lending their steadfast love and support.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, continuing the tradition of my predecessors in office, do hereby proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day.  I invite the Governors of the States and Territories and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to provide for the observance of Armed Forces Day within their jurisdiction each year in an appropriate manner designed to increase public understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces of the United States. I also invite veterans, civic, and other organizations to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day each year.  Finally, I call upon all Americans to display the flag of the United States at their homes and businesses on Armed Forces Day, and I urge citizens to learn more about military service by attending and participating in the local observances of the day.  Proclamation 9452 of May 20, 2016, is hereby superseded.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9616—National Maritime Day, 2017",2017-05-19,"On National Maritime Day, we recognize the important role the United States Merchant Marine plays in supporting our commerce and national security. We honor the proud history of our merchant mariners and their important contributions in strengthening our economy.  Americans have long looked to the sea as a source of safety and well-being. Bounded by two oceans and the Gulf of Mexico, and crisscrossed by inland waterways, America was destined to be a maritime nation. Our fledgling Republic expanded and became stronger, as our Nation's growing Merchant Marine connected the States and cemented ties among our new allies.  Today, the men and women who crew ships remain essential to our Nation's prosperity and security. Those in the maritime industry, including merchant mariners, promote our economic growth, facilitating the export of more than $475 billion in goods just last year and sustaining our critical defense industrial base. Merchant mariners also actively protect our homeland, serving as our eyes and ears on the seas. They serve with distinction and courage, heading into war zones, and too often sacrificing their own lives for our protection.  The Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933, has designated May 22 of each year as ""National Maritime Day,"" to commemorate the first transoceanic voyage by a steamship, in 1819 by the S.S. Savannah. By this resolution, the Congress has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 22, 2017, as National Maritime Day. I call upon the people of the United States to mark this observance and to display the flag of the United States at their homes and in their communities. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9617—Prayer for Peace, Memorial Day, 2017",2017-05-24,"Memorial Day is our Nation's solemn reminder that freedom is never free. It is a moment of collective reflection on the noble sacrifices of those who gave the last measure of devotion in service of our ideals and in the defense of our Nation. On this ceremonious day, we remember the fallen, we pray for a lasting peace among nations, and we honor these guardians of our inalienable rights.  This year, we commemorate the centennial anniversary of America's entry into World War I. More than 4.7 million Americans served during The Great War, representing more than 25 percent of the American male population between the ages of 18 and 31 at the time. We remember the more than 100,000 Americans who sacrificed their lives during ""The War to End All Wars,"" and who left behind countless family members and loved ones. We pause again to pray for the souls of those heroes who, one century ago, never returned home after helping to restore peace in Europe.  On Memorial Day we honor the final resting places of the more than one million men and women who sacrificed their lives for our Nation, by decorating their graves with the stars and stripes, as generations have done since 1868. We also proudly fly America's beautiful flag at our homes, businesses, and in our community parades to honor their memory. In doing so, we pledge our Nation's allegiance to the great cause of freedom for which they fought and ultimately died.  In honor and recognition of all of our fallen service members, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested the President issue a proclamation calling on the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace and designating a period on that day when the people of the United States might unite in prayer. The Congress, by Public Law 106-579, has also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Memorial Day, May 29, 2017, as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at 11:00 a.m. of that day as a time when people might unite in prayer. I urge the press, radio, television, and all other information media to cooperate in this observance.  I further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day.  I also request the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and the appropriate officials of all units of government, to direct that the flag be flown at half-staff until noon on this Memorial Day on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels throughout the United States and in all areas under its jurisdiction and control. I also request the people of the United States to display the flag at half-staff from their homes for the customary forenoon period.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9618—African-American Music Appreciation Month, 2017",2017-05-31,"During June, we pay tribute to the contributions African Americans have made and continue to make to American music. The indelible legacy of these musicians—who have witnessed our Nation's greatest achievements, as well as its greatest injustices—give all Americans a richer, deeper understanding of American culture. Their creativity has shaped every genre of music, including rock and roll, rhythm and blues, jazz, gospel, hip hop, and rap.  In March, rock and roll lost Chuck Berry, one of its founding fathers. Berry's signature style on the guitar, on display in classics like ""Johnny B. Goode,"" ""Roll Over Beethoven,"" ""Maybellene,"" and ""Carol,"" came to define the explosive new sound of rock and roll. As Keith Richards, guitarist for the Rolling Stones said while introducing Berry into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: ""This is the gentleman who started it all.""  We also take time this month to recognize the musical influence of two of the greatest jazz musicians of all time, Dizzy Gillespie and Ella Fitzgerald, as this year marks their centennial birthdays. Gillespie, through his legendary trumpet sound and Fitzgerald, through her pure, energetic voice, treated people around the world to spirited and soulful jazz music. Their work has influenced countless musicians, and continues to inspire listeners young and old.  The contributions of Berry, Gillespie, Fitzgerald, and other African-American musicians shine as examples of how music can bring us together. These musicians also remind us of our humanity and of our power to overcome. They expressed the soul of blues, gospel, and rock and roll, which has so often captured the hardships of racism and injustices suffered by African Americans, as well as daily joys and celebrations. Their work highlights the power music has to channel the human experience, and they remain a testament to the resilience of all freedom-loving people. We are grateful for their contribution to the cannon of great American art.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as African-American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, educators, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate activities and programs that raise awareness and appreciation of African-American Music.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9619—Great Outdoors Month, 2017",2017-05-31,"With June comes the summer sun, longer days, and warmer weather—the perfect opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors. During Great Outdoors Month, we encourage all Americans to experience the beauty and adventure of our Nation's lakes, mountains, and forests, and even of their own backyards.  Each of our States and territories provides endless opportunities to enjoy the great outdoors. Americans can go fishing in Eleven Mile State Park in Colorado, camp on the bluffs of Perrot State Park in Wisconsin, and bike along the Sable River in Ludington State Park in Michigan. These lands and waters are also home to cultural and historic sites that inspire our love of country and serve as important touchstones for who we are as Americans.  Whether your great outdoors means a community park, a state reservoir, a national forest, or a backyard campout, we must cherish our outdoor spaces and work to preserve them for generations. This is why, as President, I am working to bring leaders throughout the country together to improve the management of our vitally important public lands, especially through public-private partnerships to help clear the backlog of deferred maintenance.  I urge all Americans to set aside time during the month of June to visit our great outdoors and experience America's natural and cultural history. This month in particular, we celebrate our Nation's remarkable natural heritage and express our gratitude to those who help preserve our natural habitat for generations of Americans to come.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as Great Outdoors Month. I urge all Americans to explore the great outdoors while acting as stewards of our lands and waters.

Trump: Proclamation 9620—National Caribbean-American Heritage Month, 2017",2017-05-31,"National Caribbean-American Heritage Month is a celebration of the accomplishments of Caribbean Americans and our long, shared history with the peoples of the Caribbean. We are grateful for the culture Caribbean Americans have shared with our Nation and the many contributions they have made to our society.  Throughout our history, Caribbean Americans have helped create and maintain the strength and independence of our Nation. Alexander Hamilton, who came from poverty in Nevis, was a key contributor to our Constitution and the first Secretary of the Treasury, helping to establish our modern financial system and to create the United States Coast Guard.  Every day, Caribbean Americans help make America more prosperous and secure. Our Nation is particularly grateful to the many Caribbean Americans who have served and are currently serving in our Armed Forces, protecting our Nation, and promoting freedom and peace around the world. Today, more than four million Caribbean Americans live in the United States and continue to contribute to a vibrant culture that enriches our Nation.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as National Caribbean-American Heritage Month.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9621—National Homeownership Month, 2017",2017-05-31,"During National Homeownership Month, we recognize the many benefits of homeownership to our families, our communities, and our Nation. For generations of Americans, owning a home has been an essential element in achieving the American Dream. Homeownership is often the foundation of security and prosperity for families and communities and an enduring symbol of American freedom. This month, we recommit to ensuring that hard-working Americans enjoy a fair chance at becoming homeowners.  In the years since the Great Recession, homeownership rates have dipped to historic lows. Many Americans are not confident they will ever own a home, a tragic consequence of a decade of weak economic growth, excessive regulations, and stagnant wages. Many young families are unable to achieve the independence they desire because they have difficulty saving for a down payment, overcoming regulatory burdens, or gaining access to adequate credit. These challenges are even more pronounced for minorities, whose homeownership rates remain substantially below those of their fellow Americans.  I am committed to helping hard-working Americans become homeowners. As part of my Administration's plan to strengthen the middle class and the American housing market, I am working with the Congress on a pro-growth agenda of reducing rules and regulations, cutting taxes, and eliminating unnecessary government spending. These policies will unshackle our economy and create and sustain high-paying jobs so that more Americans have the resources and freedom they deserve to fulfill their American Dream.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as National Homeownership Month.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9622—National Ocean Month, 2017",2017-05-31,"National Ocean Month celebrates the mighty oceans and their extraordinary resources. This month, we recognize the importance of harnessing the seas for our national security and prosperity.  Thirty-four years ago, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the creation of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, making clear America's sovereign right to explore, exploit, conserve, and manage ocean resources extending 200 nautical miles from our shores. This is the world's largest Exclusive Economic Zone, spanning more than 3.4 million square nautical miles—an area larger than the combined landmass of all 50 States. We must recognize the importance of our offshore areas to our security and economic independence, all while protecting the marine environment for present and future generations.  Today, our offshore areas remain underutilized and often unexplored. We have yet to fully leverage new technologies and unleash the forces of economic innovation to more fully develop and explore our ocean economy. In the field of energy, we have just begun to tap the potential of our oceans' oil and gas, wind, wave, and tidal resources to power the Nation. The fisheries resources of the United States are among the most valuable in the world. Growing global demand for seafood presents tremendous opportunities for expansion of our seafood exports, which can reduce our more than $13 billion seafood trade deficit.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as National Ocean Month. This month, I call upon Americans to reflect on the value and importance of the oceans not only to our security and economy, but also as a source of recreation, enjoyment, and relaxation.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Trump: Proclamation 9623—Flag Day and National Flag Week, 2017",2017-06-14,"On Flag Day, we honor the symbol that reminds us that we are one Nation under God, united in our pursuit of liberty and justice for all. Today, we celebrate and recognize June 14 as the day in 1777 when the Continental Congress formally adopted the Stars and Stripes as the official flag of the Republic.  Our flag is a source of inspiration and strength to all Americans. Wherever Old Glory flies, we remember the six United States Marines raising the flag atop Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima, astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting it on the surface of the moon, and our firefighters elevating it above Ground Zero following the terrorist attacks of September 11. At the White House, at our homes, churches, offices, and schools, in our town squares and military installations at home and abroad, our flag celebrates our independence and highlights our resolve to defend and protect the country and the values that we hold dear.  By honoring our flag, we pay due respect to the patriots and heroes who have laid down their lives in defense of the liberty it represents. As we raise the flag, we stand and salute or place our hands on our hearts, and we recall the fundamental truths upon which this Nation was founded: that we are all created equal and that just government derives its power from the people.  I am blessed to have shared my birthday with the Star Spangled Banner and the U.S. Army for 71 years now. Again, on Flag Day, I am deeply grateful to live under the red, white, and blue, and all for which it stands.  To commemorate the adoption of our flag, in 1949, the Congress requested the President recognize, by proclamation, that June 14 is ""Flag Day"" and requested the American flag be displayed on all Federal Government buildings. The Congress also requested, in 1966, that the President annually issue a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as ""National Flag Week"" and call upon citizens of the United States to display the flag during that week.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 14, 2017, as Flag Day, and this week as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials to display the flag on all Federal Government buildings during this week, and I urge all Americans to observe Flag Day and National Flag Week by displaying the flag. I also encourage the people of the United States to observe with pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence Day, set aside by the Congress (89 Stat. 211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings and activities, and to publicly recite the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9624—Father's Day, 2017",2017-06-16,"Father's Day is a special occasion that reminds us to pause and thank the men in our lives who have taken on the responsibility of raising children. As sons and daughters, we recognize the love they have given and the sacrifices they have made, and we celebrate the indispensable role fathers play in our lives and communities.  Fathers have the ability and responsibility to instill in us core values we carry into adulthood. The examples they set and the lessons they impart about hard work, dedication to family, faith in God, and believing in ourselves establish the moral foundation for success that allows us to live up to our full potential. We remember those fatherly moments big and small—throwing a baseball, writing an essay, driving a car, walking down the aisle—that have shaped us, and we thank our dads for being there with a helping hand and an open heart.  Day in and day out, fathers put their children first, creating loving and supportive environments. Whether by birth, adoption, or foster care, today we honor the incredible fathers in our lives for all they have done and continue to do for us. Fathers inspire us to better ourselves and to be men and women of outstanding character. We recommit ourselves as individuals, families, and communities to promoting and supporting fatherhood, and take this day to express our love and appreciation for fathers across our country.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress approved April 24, 1972, as amended (36 U.S.C. 109), do hereby proclaim June 18, 2017, as Father's Day. I call on United States Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Father's Day and invite State and local governments and the people of the United States to observe Father's Day with appropriate ceremonies.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Donald J. Trump: Proclamation 9625—To Modify Duty-Free Treatment Under the Generalized System of Preferences and for Other Purposes,2017-06-29,"1. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ""1974 Act"") (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(A)), the President may, after receiving the advice of the United States International Trade Commission (the ""Commission""), designate certain articles as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) when they are imported from designated beneficiary developing countries.  2. Pursuant to sections 501, 503(a)(1)(A), and 503(b)(5) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(b)(5)), and having received advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), I have determined to designate certain articles as eligible articles when they are imported from beneficiary developing countries.  3. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(1)), the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit application of the duty-free treatment accorded to specified articles under the GSP when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries.  4. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1) of the 1974 Act, and having considered the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(c)), I have determined to withdraw the application of duty-free treatment accorded to a certain article.  5. Section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)) subjects beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries as provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), to competitive need limitations on the preferential treatment afforded to eligible articles under the GSP.  6. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(A) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that in 2016 certain beneficiary developing countries exported eligible articles in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need limitations. I hereby terminate the duty-free treatment for such articles from such beneficiary developing countries.  7. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) provides that the President may disregard the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if the aggregate appraised value of the imports of any such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed the amount set forth in section 503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)).  8. Pursuant to section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that the competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect to certain eligible articles from certain beneficiary developing countries. 9. Section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(1)) provides that the President may waive the application of the competitive need limitations in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)) with respect to any eligible article from any beneficiary developing country if certain conditions are met.  10. Pursuant to section 503(d)(1) of the 1974 Act, I have received the advice of the Commission on whether any industry in the United States is likely to be adversely affected by such waivers of the competitive need limitations provided in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act. I have determined, based on that advice and the considerations described in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, and having given great weight to the considerations in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such waivers are in the national economic interest of the United States. Accordingly, I have determined that the competitive need limitations of section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act should be waived with respect to a certain eligible article from a certain beneficiary developing country.  11. Presidential Proclamation 8997 of June 27, 2013, suspended Bangladesh's designation as a beneficiary developing country for the purposes of the GSP. Presidential Proclamation 9333 of September 30, 2015, terminated Venezuela's designation as a beneficiary developing country for the purposes of the GSP. These proclamations made corresponding modifications to general note 4 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Those modifications included technical errors, and I have determined that modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct them.  12. Presidential Proclamation 9466 of June 30, 2016, implemented the World Trade Organization Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (the ""Declaration"") and, pursuant to section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)), modified the HTS to include the schedule of duty reductions necessary to carry out the Declaration. Those modifications included technical errors, and I have determined that modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct them.  13. Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, implemented modifications to the HTS, pursuant to section 1206(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the ""1988 Act"") (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)), to include changes to the schedule considered necessary or appropriate by the Commission to accomplish the purposes of section 1205(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(a)). Those modifications to the HTS were set out in Publication 3898 of the Commission, entitled ""Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States under Section 1206 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988,"" which was incorporated by reference into Presidential Proclamation 8097. Annex I to that publication included a technical error, and I have determined that a modification to the HTS is necessary to correct it.  14. Presidential Proclamation 9549 of December 1, 2016, implemented modifications to the HTS, pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, to include changes to the schedule considered necessary or appropriate by the Commission to accomplish the purposes of section 1205(a) of the 1988 Act. Those modifications to the HTS were set out in Publication 4653 of the Commission, entitled ""Modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States under Section 1206 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 and for Other Purposes,"" which was incorporated by reference into Presidential Proclamation 9549. Annex I to that publication included technical errors, and I have determined that modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct them.  15. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.  Now, Therefore, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that:  (1) In order to designate certain articles as eligible articles when imported from a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings is modified as set forth in section A of Annex I to this proclamation.  (2) In order to provide that one or more countries should no longer be treated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to one or more eligible articles for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for the corresponding HTS subheadings and general note 4(d) to the HTS are modified as set forth in sections B, C, and D of Annex I to this proclamation.  (3) The competitive need limitation provided in section 503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the 1974 Act is disregarded with respect to the eligible articles in the HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries listed in Annex II to this proclamation, effective July 1, 2017.  (4) A waiver of the application of section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act shall apply to the article in the HTS subheading and to the beneficiary developing country set forth in Annex III to this proclamation, effective July 1, 2017.  (5) In order to make technical corrections necessary to reflect the suspension of benefits under the GSP with respect to Bangladesh and the termination of benefits under the GSP with respect to Venezuela, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex IV to this proclamation.  (6) In order to make technical corrections necessary to provide the intended tariff treatment to goods covered by the Declaration in accordance with Presidential Proclamation 9466 of June 30, 2016, and to certain goods as recommended in Publications 3898 and 4653 of the Commission, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex V.  (7) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annexes I, IV, and V to this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates set forth in the relevant sections of Annexes I, IV, and V.  (8) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.  In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation—Captive Nations Week, 2017",2017-07-14,"During Captive Nations Week, we stand in solidarity with those living under repressive regimes, and we commit to promoting our American ideals, grounded in respect for natural rights and protected by the rule of law, throughout the world. As President Reagan often reminded us, as a shining city upon a hill, America has a duty to shine its beacon light on freedom?loving people around the world. President Eisenhower first proclaimed Captive Nations Week during the Cold War with the Soviet Union, promising that America would stand with those people in captive nations who seek ""freedom and national independence."" The Soviet Union collapsed more than a quarter of a century ago, but hundreds of millions of people around the world still live under the tyranny of authoritarian regimes. Authoritarianism and its many injustices have wrought misery and held captive the dreams of generations, while nations that value liberty have prospered and empowered their citizens to pursue their God-given potential to the fullest.  The injustices and abuses authoritarian regimes inflict on their own people affect us all, and we must recognize the bond we share with those who long to be free from oppression. Throughout our Nation's history, brave Americans have fought for the freedom of those suffering under authoritarianism. These American service members have shined light in the darkest corners of the world, those that are marred by starvation, political imprisonment, religious intolerance, and many other civil rights abuses.  Our military and diplomatic experiences have taught us that freedom is a powerful, yet fragile force that must be tirelessly protected. We continue to encourage despotic regimes to turn away from their oppressive ideologies and embrace a more hopeful and prosperous future for their people. This week, and always, we stand with all people throughout the world who are fighting for liberty, justice, and the rule of law. The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July of each year as ""Captive Nations Week."" NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 16 through July 22, 2017, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon all Americans to reaffirm our commitment to those around the world striving for liberty, justice, and the rule of law. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation—Made in America Day and Made in America Week, 2017",2017-07-17,"Today, we mark the first Made in America Day and recognize the vital contributions of American workers and job creators to our Nation's prosperity and strength. America owes much of its success to the determination and ingenuity of its entrepreneurs, workers, and farmers, who drive our economy and support our military strength.  American work ethic and quality craftsmanship are the heart and soul of our Nation. We are a Nation of innovators, builders, and farmers. We construct architectural wonders like the Golden Gate Bridge and the New York skyline. We feed the Nation and the world with agricultural products like American wheat, corn, and beef. We drive technological innovation, like the internet and the Global Positioning System, from visions to realities. My Administration recognizes the critical connection between a strong manufacturing base and a thriving economy. I am committed to promoting American manufacturing, opening markets around the world for our producers, and protecting our businesses from unfair trade practices. And I am reducing job?killing regulations and cutting taxes, making it more attractive than ever to do business in the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 17, 2017, as Made in America Day and this week, July 16 through July 22, as Made in America Week. Today and this week, I call upon Americans to pay special tribute to the builders, to the ranchers, to the crafters, and to all those who work every day to make America great. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation—Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 2017",2017-07-25,"On the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), we celebrate the landmark legislation that marks our Nation's commitment to ending discrimination against people with disabilities. The ADA's recognition of the inherent dignity of disabled persons solidified America's status as the world leader in protecting fundamental rights. Today, we pay special respect to the contributions of the more than 56 million Americans living with disabilities, and we look forward to further advancing accessibility for all those who need it. President George H.W. Bush signed the ADA on July 26, 1990, and for 27 years it has been instrumental in protecting the rights and liberties of people with disabilities and strengthening their access to everyday American life. Disabilities are an unavoidable part of the human experience ?? veterans injured in service to their Nation, survivors of accidents and illnesses, children born with disabilities, and our elderly. Since its inception, the ADA has helped empower people living with disabilities by ensuring they have fair and just access to employment, government services, public accommodations, commercial facilities, and public transportation. Americans are justifiably proud of the ADA and its accomplishments, but more can be done to protect the rights and dignity of Americans living with disabilities. Disabled Americans in the workforce already contribute substantially to our Nation's productivity and prosperity. We must continue to empower them by breaking down obstacles that prevent their full participation in the public and economic affairs of our Nation. In addition, my Administration will encourage American ingenuity and technological advancements in medicine and science, which will give millions of Americans with disabilities opportunities to work, engage in commerce, and connect with others in ways we could not have imagined 27 years ago. On the anniversary of the ADA, we reaffirm our commitment to fostering an environment that provides all Americans with the opportunity to pursue their American dream. Let us all take this time to refocus our efforts to support our fellow Americans and help them succeed, no matter the obstacles they may face. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 26, 2017, as a day in celebration of the 27th Anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that celebrate the contributions of Americans with disabilities and to renew our commitment to achieving the promise of our freedom for all Americans. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second.

"Donald J. Trump: Proclamation—National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, 2017",2017-07-26,"On National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day, we honor the patriots who defended the Korean Peninsula against the spread of Communism in what became the first major conflict of the Cold War. We remember those who laid down their lives in defense of liberty, in a land far from home, and we vow to preserve their legacy. Situated between World War II and the Vietnam War, the Korean War has often been labeled as the ""Forgotten War,"" despite its having claimed the lives of more than 36,000 Americans. The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when North Korean forces, backed by the Soviet Union, invaded South Korea. Shortly thereafter, American troops arrived and pushed back the North Koreans. For 3 years, alongside fifteen allies and partners, we fought an unrelenting war of attrition. Through diplomatic engagements led by President Eisenhower, Americans secured peace on the Korean Peninsula. On July 27, 1953, North Korea, China, and the United Nations signed an armistice suspending all hostilities. While the armistice stopped the active fighting in the region, North Korea's ballistic and nuclear weapons programs continue to pose grave threats to the United States and our allies and partners. At this moment, more than 28,000 American troops maintain a strong allied presence along the 38th parallel, which separates North and South Korea. These troops, and the rest of our Armed Forces, help me fulfill my unwavering commitment as President to protecting Americans at home and to steadfastly defending our allies abroad. As we reflect upon our values and pause to remember all those who fight and sacrifice to uphold them, we will never forget our Korean War veterans whose valiant efforts halted the spread of Communism and advanced the cause of freedom. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 27, 2017, as National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities that honor and give thanks to our distinguished Korean War veterans. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-second. DONALD J. TRUMP"
