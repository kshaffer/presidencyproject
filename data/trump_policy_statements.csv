Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 7 - No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017,2017-01-24,"(House)(Rep. Smith, R-New Jersey, and 47 cosponsors)  The Administration strongly supports H.R. 7. The legislation would prohibit any funds authorized or appropriated by Federal law to be expended for any abortion, or for direct payments to insurers for health benefits coverage that includes coverage for abortions. H.R. 7 also would prohibit the purchase of abortion coverage with matching funds from federally subsidized programs, including Federal and State Medicaid funds. The legislation would not relate to the treatment of any complication caused by or worsened by an abortion, nor to the treatment of abortions in the case of rape, incest, or preserving the life of the mother. This bill would continue to prohibit the Federal government from paying for affected procedures with the taxes of Americans who find abortion morally or religiously objectionable. If the President were presented with H.R. 7 in its present form, he would sign the bill."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.J. Res. 38, H.J. Res. 36, H.J. Res. 41, H.J. Res. 40, & H.J. Res. 37",2017-02-01,"(House) H.J. Res. 38 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of the Interior Known as the Stream Protection Rule(Rep. Johnson, R-OH, and 67 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 36 – Disapproving the Bureau of Land Management's Final Rule Relating to ""Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation""(Rep. Bishop, R-UT, and 33 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 41 – Disapproving the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule on Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers(Rep. Huizenga, R-MI, and 32 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 40 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Social Security Administration Relating to Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007(Rep. Johnson, R-TX, and 120 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 37 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation(Rep. Foxx, R-NC, and 3 cosponsors) The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations imposed on America's businesses. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act have established burdensome compliance requirements that force jobs out of our communities and discourage doing business in the United States. The House is also considering overturning a Social Security Administration Rule that would prevent some Americans with disabilities from purchasing or possessing firearms based on their decision to seek Social Security benefits. H.J. Res. 38 would nullify the Stream Protection Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 93066 (Dec. 20, 2016), a final rule recently promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The bill disapproves a rule that would establish onerous requirements for coal mining operations, and impose significant compliance burdens on America's coal production. The disapproved rule also duplicates existing protections in the Clean Water Act and is unnecessary given the other Federal and State regulations already in place. The Administration is committed to reviving America's coal mining communities, which have been hurting for too long. H.J. Res. 36 would nullify the final rule Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation. 81 Fed. Reg. 83008 (Nov. 18, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management. The bill disapproves an expensive rule that would require oil and gas producers to reduce natural gas waste and emissions, regardless of whether or not it is economically viable to do so. The majority of affected oil and gas operators are small businesses, and productive wells could be unnecessarily shut in to meet the requirements of this rule. While minimizing waste remains an important component of responsible energy development, the Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burdens on American businesses, supporting energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans, maximizing the use of American resources, and freeing us from dependence on foreign oil. H.J. Res. 41 would nullify the final rule Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, 81 Fed. Reg. 49359 (July 27, 2016), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bill disapproves a rule that would require resource extraction issuers to report payments made to governments for the commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals. In some cases, the rule would require companies to disclose information that the host nation of their project prohibits from disclosure or is commercially sensitive. The rule would impose unreasonable compliance costs on American energy companies that are not justified by quantifiable benefits. Moreover, American businesses could face a competitive disadvantage in cases where their foreign competitors are not subject to similar rules. H.J. Res. 40 would nullify the final rule Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 Fed. Reg. 91702 (Dec. 19, 2016), promulgated by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The bill disapproves a rule that would allow SSA to provide records on certain individuals who receive Disability Insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act or Supplemental Security Income payments under title XVI of the Social Security Act to the Attorney General for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The rule would prevent some Americans with disabilities from purchasing or possessing firearms based on their decision to seek Social Security benefits. Applications of this rule could endanger the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens. H.J. Res. 37 would nullify the rule Federal Acquisition Regulation; Fair Pay and Safe Workspaces, 81 Fed. Reg. 58562 (August 25, 2016). The bill disapproves a rule that would require federal contractors to disclose findings of non-compliance with labor laws. The rule would bog down Federal procurement with unnecessary and burdensome processes that would result in delays, and decreased competition for Federal government contracts. Rolling back this rule will also help to reduce costs in Federal procurement. The Administration is committed to reducing onerous regulatory burdens on America's businesses and using existing authorities to continue enforcing the Nation's workplace laws. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.J. Res. 42, H.J. Res. 44, H.J. Res. 57, H.J. & H.J. Res. 58",2017-02-07,"(House) H.J. Res. 42 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants(Rep. Brady, R-TX, and 25 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 44 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of the Interior Relating to Bureau of Land Management Regulations that Establish the Procedures Used to Prepare, Revise, or Amend Land Use Plans Pursuant to the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976(Rep. Cheney, R-WY, and 16 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 57 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Accountability and State Plans Under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965(Rep. Rokita, R-IN, and 12 cosponsors) H.J. Res. 58 – Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Teacher Preparation Issues(Rep. Guthrie, R-KY, and 12 cosponsors) The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education. H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor. The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested. The rule imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands. The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development. Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities' interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions. H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act – Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (Nov. 29, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress. While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. H.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program Accountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality of teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program. The rule imposes new burdensome and costly data reporting requirements on States and institutions of higher education. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.J. Res. 83 - Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to ""Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness""",2017-02-28,"(House)(Rep. Byrne, R-AL) The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.J. Res. 83. The resolution would nullify the final rule titled ""Clarification of Employer's Continuing Obligation to Make and Maintain an Accurate Record of Each Recordable Injury and Illness,"" 81 Fed. Reg. 91792 (Dec. 19, 2016) promulgated by the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The rule purports to clarify OSHA's recordkeeping requirements by allowing OSHA to cite employers for up to five years for failing to make and maintain injury and illness records. The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burdens on America's businesses, and this rule imposes costs on employers resulting from continuing recordkeeping obligations. If this bill were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign it into law."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 998, H.R. 1004 & H.R. 1009",2017-02-28,"(House) H.R. 998 – Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome (SCRUB) Act(Rep. Smith, R-MO, and three cosponsors) H.R. 1004 – Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017(Rep. Walberg, R-MI, and eight cosponsors) H.R. 1009 – OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act(Rep. Mitchell, R-MI, and four cosponsors) The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burden on all Americans. On January 30, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, which provides for repeal of two regulations for every new one issued. This historic step accelerates the retrospective review process to make common-sense reforms to regulations across the Federal Government. Legislation is helpful where it amends agencies' regulatory processes to ensure they are transparent, and appropriately balance costs and benefits. Each of these bills would address different aspects of the regulatory process. The SCRUB Act, H.R. 998, addresses the numerous outdated, duplicative, and otherwise unnecessary regulations that have accumulated throughout government. The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, H.R. 1004, would restrict the use of agency funds to advocate on behalf of regulations, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act, H.R. 1009, would codify specific executive branch regulatory review procedures. The Administration supports the SCRUB Act, the Regulatory Integrity Act, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on technical and other amendments to these bills. The Administration appreciates the efforts of the Congress to rationalize the regulatory system and looks forward to continuing to work together to reform the regulatory process."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1301 - Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2017",2017-03-07,"(House Rules)(Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ) The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1301, making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year (FY) ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes. The bill funds critical national security needs. The Administration is committed to working with the Congress on a sustained effort to rebuild the military. In the coming weeks, the Administration plans to request additional FY 2017 appropriations to improve the warfighting readiness of the military and provide the resources needed to accelerate the defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress as the FY 2017 appropriations process moves forward."
Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.J. Res. 67 and 66 - Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor,2017-03-13,"(Senate) H.J. Res. 66 - Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non Governmental Employees(Rep. Walberg, R-MI, and seven cosponsors) H.J. Res. 67 - Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Savings Arrangements Established by Qualified State Political Subdivisions for Non Governmental Employees(Rep. Rooney, R-FL, and seven cosponsors) The Administration strongly supports Senate passage of H.J. Res. 66 and H.J. Res. 67. These joint resolutions of disapproval would nullify two rules promulgated by the Employee Benefits Security Administration of the Department of Labor: (1) Savings Arrangements Established by States for Non-Governmental Employees, 81 Fed. Reg. 59464 (Aug. 30, 2016); and (2) Savings Arrangements Established by Qualified State Political Subdivisions for Non-Governmental Employees, 81 Fed. Reg. 92639 (Dec. 20, 2016), respectively. The rules allow a new type of State-based retirement plan that would lack important Federal protections, and they would give a competitive advantage to these public plans. These joint resolutions would prevent the Department of Labor from reissuing a rule that is substantially the same as the disapproved rule absent specific future congressional authorization. If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law."
Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1101 - Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017,2017-03-21,"(House)(Rep. Johnson, R-TX, and 37 cosponsors) The Administration supports H.R. 1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017. The Administration is committed to providing American workers with new options for access to quality, affordable care. The bill would strengthen access to health coverage for workers in the Nation's small businesses, many of which struggle to provide their employees with healthcare benefits due to dramatic increases in premiums and healthcare costs under the Affordable Care Act. H.R. 1101 would enable small businesses to provide health benefits to their workers through trade and professional associations, potentially benefiting millions of American families. Forming Association Health Plans (AHPs) would help to closer align options for small businesses with those available to large businesses and labor unions, which are able to offer their employees and members common health benefits across State lines. Small businesses also would benefit from larger risk pools, increased negotiating power, and administrative efficiencies, decreasing costs for their workers. AHPs are an important step toward reducing costs and expanding opportunities for quality healthcare. If H.R. 1101 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law."
Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 372 - Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017,2017-03-21,"(House)(Rep. Gosar, R-AZ, and 20 cosponsors) The Administration supports H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017. Many Americans have seen their health insurance premiums increase, and healthcare options decrease, significantly under the Affordable Care Act. The Administration supports efforts to restore competition to the health insurance marketplace in order to lower costs and expand choices for consumers. H.R. 372 would amend the McCarran-Ferguson Act to ensure that Federal antitrust laws apply to the business of health insurance. The bill supports the goal of giving American families and businesses more control over their own healthcare choices by promoting greater health insurance competition. The bill would specifically prohibit businesses from engaging in anti-competitive practices, including price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocation that could drive up healthcare costs. If H.R. 372 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law."
Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1628 – American Health Care Act of 2017,2017-03-22,"(House)(Rep. Black, R-TN) The Administration strongly supports H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017 (AHCA). This bill begins to fulfill the President's commitment to rescue Americans from the failures of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and expand access to affordable, quality healthcare. The AHCA offers patient-centered healthcare solutions that will promote innovation, reduce health insurance premiums, and empower doctors and patients to make healthcare choices. The AHCA makes significant and important changes as part of a three step process to repeal and replace the ACA. The AHCA would provide tax credits for Americans to promote affordability; improve Medicaid's sustainability and target resources to those most in need; and return healthcare choices to patients by expanding the use of health savings accounts. The AHCA also would provide for a stable transition from the onerous requirements of the ACA, while providing peace of mind to Americans with pre-existing conditions. If H.R. 1628 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law."
Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: S.J. Res. 34 - Disapproving the Federal Communications Commission's Rule on Privacy of Customers of Broadband Services,2017-03-28,"(Sen. Flake, R-AZ, and 24 cosponsors) The Administration strongly supports House passage of S.J.Res. 34, which would nullify the Federal Communications Commission's final rule titled ""Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunication Services,"" 81 Fed. Reg. 87274 (December 2, 2016). The rule applies the privacy requirements of the Communications Act of 1934 to broadband Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and other telecommunications carriers. In particular, the rule requires ISPs to obtain affirmative ""opt-in"" consent from consumers to use and share certain information, including app usage and web browsing history. It also allows ISPs to use and share other information, including e-mail addresses and service tier information, unless a customer ""opts-out."" In doing so, the rule departs from the technology-neutral framework for online privacy administered by the Federal Trade Commission. This results in rules that apply very different regulatory regimes based on the identity of the online actor. If S.J.Res. 34 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law."
Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 1180 – Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017,2017-05-02,"(House)(Rep. Roby, R-AL, and 17 cosponsors) The Administration supports H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2017. H.R. 1180 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow private-sector employers to give their employees the choice to receive paid time off instead of cash payments for each hour of time for which overtime compensation would otherwise be required. The bill would extend to private-sector workers a choice that public-sector employees have long enjoyed. H.R. 1180 would help American workers balance the competing demands of family and work by giving them flexibility to earn paid time off—time they can later use for any reason, including family commitments like attending school appointments and caring for a sick child. In addition, H.R. 1180 contains critical protections to ensure employees can continue to choose overtime pay and to prohibit employers from coercing their employees to accept compensatory time instead of overtime pay. If H.R. 1180 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law."
"Donald J. Trump: Statement of Administration Policy: H.R. 244 — Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017",2017-05-02,"(House Rules)(Rep. Frelinghuysen, R-NJ) This Statement of Administration Policy provides views on the House amendment to Senate amendments to H.R. 244, which contains the text of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017. The Administration appreciates the bill's provision of much-needed funding for our military, including approximately $21 billion of the requested $30 billion additional in appropriations that the President submitted to the Congress in March 2017. These funds would accelerate the President's campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, as well as support ongoing efforts to rebuild and modernize the U.S. Armed Forces. By providing these funds without a corresponding increase in lower priority non-defense funding, this bill rejects the ""parity"" construct that for years has jeopardized critical increases in defense spending. In total, the bill represents a $25.7 billion increase in Department of Defense funding over fiscal year (FY) 2016 levels. The bill increases end strength by adding 24,000 active-duty forces and 12,000 selected reserve forces above the previous Administration's request for FY 2017. It also invests in both near and long-term readiness, provides direct support to our warfighters through new and improved equipment, and increases pay for our troops. In FY 2018, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to increase overall defense funding by fully eliminating defense sequestration in a fiscally responsible manner. While the Administration will continue to push for additional funding to stop human and drug trafficking, interdict violent gangs and cartels, and support other enforcement priorities, the bill is a good first step, and does make available an additional $1.5 billion for the Department of Homeland Security. Further, the total funding provided for U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement is $18.5 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion over FY 2016. The Administration is also concerned that the Congress did not exercise fiscal restraint, as it failed to include responsible reductions to non-defense discretionary spending to offset higher spending elsewhere. The Administration is also disappointed that this bill provides almost $300 million for Puerto Rico's Medicaid program without underlying reforms to Puerto Rico's struggling healthcare system, which, like so many aspects of the United States healthcare system, has been badly damaged by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Administration believes that any sustainable solution to Puerto Rico's dire fiscal situation must include the enactment of pro-growth policies for the island. The Administration strongly supports the inclusion of the District of Columbia Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Reauthorization Act, which delivers on the President's promise to provide school choice. The Administration also supports the various provisions in the bill that continue protections for the sanctity of life and the Second Amendment. More generally, the Administration looks forward to working with the Congress to return to regular order for the FY 2018 appropriations process, and to enacting legislation that reflects the President's priorities to keep our Nation safe and create jobs and prosperity for American workers. If the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law."
