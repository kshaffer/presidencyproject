Sarah Huckabee Sanders: Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders,2017-02-28,"3:07 P.M. EST MS. SANDERS: Good Afternoon. Sorry for the delay. Obviously, I never want to step on anything the President is doing, so I wanted to wait until he finished. The President has obviously got a full day and night planned, so I'm going to try to keep this short so that you guys can get focused on his speech coming up later. First off, and I know Sean briefly spoke about this yesterday -- and, by the way, just for clarification, he is not here, clearly, because he is up on the Hill briefing House and Senate communicators about the speech and previewing that for them right now. But Sean mentioned this yesterday, and I'm sure that it stuck with me, but the story has developed further. I wanted to address the tragic shooting in Kansas. The President is keeping the family of the victim, who was senselessly, killed in his thoughts, and we're praying for the full and speedy recovery of those who were wounded. As more facts come to light, and it begins to look like this was an act of racially-motivated hatred, we want to reiterate that the President condemns these and any other racially- or religiously-motivated attacks in the strongest terms. They have no place in our country, and we will continue to make that clear. In regards to the rest of the events today, this morning the Vice President swore in Secretary Ross as the Secretary of Commerce in his ceremonial office, and the President knows Secretary Ross is eager to get started building the country back up again, and we're glad to finally have him in place at the Commerce Department to do just that. Moving on to the President's day, this morning, after receiving his national daily intelligence briefing, the President met with the National Association of Attorneys General, and then had lunch with members of the press, as is tradition for the day of the joint address to Congress.  This afternoon, the President, as most of you saw, just signed two bills and executive orders. The first bill, H.R. 321, also known as the INSPIRE Act, encourages NASA to have women and girls participate in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and to pursue careers in aerospace using extreme programs and resources.  H.R. 255, or the Promoting Women and Entrepreneurship Act, is a similar bill targeted to the National Science Foundation. The bill encourages NSF to also use existing programs to recruit and support the employment of women in the sciences. These bills are the next step in the President's continued focus on empowering women of all ages and all interests to pursue their chosen careers.  As you saw, the President and Prime Minister Trudeau spent an afternoon speaking with female business leaders about the unique challenges facing women in the workplace earlier this month. And just last week, during his listening session with manufacturing CEOs, the President heard from a breakout group focused specifically on policies that could help lessen or remove some of those same barriers. The President also signed two executive orders. The first instructs the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to review and reconsider the Obama administration's Clean Water Rule, as well as providing instruction to the Attorney General for current legal action on the rule. The Obama administration's rule vastly expands federal jurisdiction into state and local areas, and the decisions that directly affects them, and that's something that this administration does not take lightly.  The second executive order will make Historically Black Colleges and Universities a priority again in the White House. This order provides a framework for repositioning the HBCU initiative in the White House, allowing it to function across all executive departments and agencies in consultation with the Department of Education. As you might have seen yesterday, the President welcomed the over 60 presidents of HBCUs and representatives from leading HBCU organizations to the Oval Office before their listening session with the Vice President and Secretary DeVos. The President is extremely committed to keeping the promises he made regarding HBCUs on the campaign trail, and looks forward to working with these leaders and organizations to provide HBCUs with the resources that they need. Later this afternoon, probably right about now, the President is meeting with the guests who will be seated with the First Lady at his first address to the Joint Congress. We provided a list and shorts bios of each of the guests via email last night. Now, I'm also able to confirm two additional guests for the First Lady: Jessica Gregory and her proud mother, Sheila Gregory. Jessica was diagnosed at birth with spina bifida, and has undergone 11 surgeries at Children's National Health System. Today, she is a dynamic 18-year-old honor student in Maryland, planning for college and a career as a public interest reporter, which was sparked by her experiences at Children's National Seacrest Studios. Later this evening, the President will proceed to the U.S. Capitol where he will address the Joint Session of Congress at 9:10 p.m. And, of course, I don't want to spoil anything, but it's safe to say that the President will be presenting a forward-looking vision to the American people. He's already proven that he can bring results and relief to this country, and a wave of optimism is surging across the country in response.  In terms of an outline of some of the policy areas the President will address during his speech, the President will specifically ask Congress to join him in coming up with and implementing solutions to restart the engine of our economy, provide more access to quality, affordable healthcare, expand educational opportunities to every child no matter their zip code, and unite with law enforcement and the military to protect our communities and our homeland. Together, with the help of Congress, state and local governments, the President will set our country back on the path to a bright future. Speaking of future, looking ahead in the schedule, I have some updates on the President's upcoming travel. On Thursday, he will travel to Virginia to give remarks aboard the USS Gerald Ford, and participate in a roundtable with military officials, shipbuilders, and community leaders. Initial guidance for that has already been sent out, and we'll have updates for credentialed media coming soon. On Friday, the President will attend a listening session on school choice at St. Andrews Catholic School in Florida, and we'll have guidance for that out soon. And with that, I'll take you questions. Phil. Q: Yeah, Sarah, thanks. Two things: First, can you -- MS. SANDERS: Of course, let's not mess with tradition here. Q: Very -- they're simple things. Can you confirm a discussion that happened with the network anchors about immigration, where apparently the President is now open to a compromise bill on immigration reform, and something he might include in the speech tonight?  And the second point is regarding the State Department budget. There are some reports out there about possibly a 37 or 38 percent cut to the State Department budget.  MS. SANDERS: So I'll start with the first question. I was not a participant in the lunch today, so not part of the specific conversation, so I can't speak to the exact conversation that took place. But I do know that the President has been very clear in his process that the immigration system is broken and needs massive reform, and he has made clear that he is open to having conversations about that and moving forward. Right now, his primary focus, as he had made over and over again, is border control and security at the border, and deporting criminals from our country, and keeping our country safe. And those priorities have not changed. Q: And the State Department? MS. SANDERS: And the State Department -- as we said before, I think -- not congressman anymore --- but OMB Director Mulvaney made it pretty clear that the budget priorities that we laid out were just that -- they were priorities. And right now, we're in a discussion process. This is the same historically today that it always works: We put out our priorities, we lay those out to the departments, they offer feedback to us, and so right now we're just in a discussion process. So there's nothing firm and exact on any numbers that may be coming out of that. Kristen. Q: Two subjects for you. Kansas -- you started off your remarks talking about it. Can we expect the President to address that tonight? And forgetting about what may or may not have been discussed, is the President open to an immigration bill that would include a pathway to citizenship without undocumented immigrants leaving the country? MS. SANDERS: On your first question, I wouldn't be surprised if that was mentioned in the speech tonight. In terms of the immigration, again, I haven't had further conversations with him about that today, but I do know that his priorities have been very clear on immigration, and that's the number one focus right now. Q: One follow on that. Is it safe to say he wouldn't -- MS. SANDERS: That's three now. Q: -- rule out -- it's a follow. It's a follow-up. MS. SANDERS: Just so you know, I'm not like Sean. I'm not going to let her set precedents and take three questions from everybody. Q: Very quick follow. Is it safe to say he wouldn't rule out the possibility of an immigration bill that would not deport people who don't have criminal records? In other words, is the focus still on those with criminal records? And is he very seriously considering some type to carve-out for those who don't have criminal records? MS. SANDERS: Again, the focus is certainly on those with a criminal background and criminal record. But until I've had a chance to have a conversation with the President, I'm not going to speak to that any further. Sure, go ahead. Q: Thank you. Two questions, of course. First off, the budget and possible reductions to the State Department. Would that indicate -- would those reductions indicate any desire to run foreign policy more directly out of the White House as opposed to through the State Department and career diplomats?  MS. SANDERS: I'm sorry, I'm not following what you're asking here. Q: Cuts to the State Department. There have been reports saying that Secretary Tillerson has been sort of marginalized in a lot of foreign policy discussions going on. And do these cuts indicate any desire to run foreign policy more directly from the White House and not through the State Department? MS. SANDERS: Well, I would disagree that Secretary Tillerson has been marginalized. I think nothing could be further from the truth. And so I wouldn't rely on sources outside of the White House in terms of who will be making decisions. And at this point, the Secretary of State is very much empowered to do that. Nothing has changed on that front. Q: Second question. MS. SANDERS: Go ahead. Q: Not to belabor a point, but to follow up on Kristen's question. The reports that are out there are still coming in about this conversation that was had today, but is it fair then to say that the President supports at least a compromise immigration bill? And then just give us a few details on how he's spending the afternoon in terms of this speech. Like, is it done? Is he still tweaking? Things like that. MS. SANDERS: I love that if we keep asking the same question we think we might get a different answer. I know. I appreciate the effort; I think you guys get As for effort. But again, I'm going to continue to say: Until I've had a chance to have that conversation with the President, I'm not going to speculate on what that would look like.  In terms of the afternoon, I know right now he is currently meeting with the people that will be seated with the First Lady. And this afternoon, he has plans to work through the speech and practice and make any last-minute changes to that.  Go ahead. Q: So those people that he's meeting with right now, is he going to be directly referencing them in his speech tonight? MS. SANDERS: I think you can rest assured that most of those names will come up in the speech tonight. Q: And any idea when the excerpts will be coming out? MS. SANDERS: I think we may have some later this afternoon. I don't know that we'll have the full text of the speech before, but I do believe we'll have at least some nuggets of the speech that we will release later today. Shaileagh (ph).  Q: Thank you. So first, on the JCC threats, apparently Pennsylvania Attorney General Shapiro is saying that in part of his conversation with the President, the President indicated that these threats may have come from ""the reverse"" or ""to make others look bad."" Do you dispute that characterization of -- what did the President mean by that? Was he saying that these anti-Semitic threats are coming from -- I don't know, you tell us. MS. SANDERS: Look, I wasn't part of a private conversation. What I do know is the conversations that I have had with the President, he's been extremely clear and extremely consistent on this topic. Any act of violence towards people of the Jewish faith is condemned by this administration. Full stop. Q: And then one on healthcare, as well. There have been -- some Republicans have now come out publicly against the draft plan that is being circulated in Congress on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Is the President concerned about the fact that more conservatives are now saying they couldn't support that plan? And what is his message to those Republicans? MS. SANDERS: Not at all, because the draft plan is exactly that -- a draft. It's meant to open up the conversation. The last several days the President has spent time with governors, he's meeting with attorney generals, he's met with CEOs of major healthcare companies to talk about how they can improve that plan. The big things that he's made a priority is that we will repeal Obamacare but replace it with something better. And that's a lot of what these conversations that he's had over the last several days are helping to do, is to make that plan better. And the one that's been floated out there is nothing more than a draft. April. Q: Sarah -- and I want to ask two questions on two different things. When it comes to inclusion, what is the President talking about tonight when it's inclusion? Is it about race? Is it about politics? What does this inclusion vision or unity vision include? MS. SANDERS: I think it's very clear, the President has made no secret from the campaign trail through the first month in office that his priority is putting Americans first. And when he says ""Americans,"" he means all Americans. He's not specifying breaking it out by demographic. He's talking about every single American, and I don't think you can be any more clear when it comes to unity than that -- and inclusion. Q: And last question, on HBCUs. There's no new money in it, but the people who came to the stakeout, who were in the room for the signing, were talking about a promise of more money. They've been looking forward to more money from (inaudible) Commerce. What is this next step for them, I guess, to do when it comes to getting more money and this promise beyond what you're already doing trying to bring the agencies together to pinpoint things (inaudible)? What is this promise of hope for money? MS. SANDERS: I'm not sure on the specific resources, but I do know that the President's priority here is making sure that the HBCUs have a direct line within the White House and not layers of bureaucracy to have to go through. And so that conversation has opened up so that he can be part of that directly. And that's a big part of moving this group back into the White House outside of the Department of Education. Q: So you don't know anything else about -- MS. SANDERS: I do know that there have been a lot of different discussions on how that could happen. Some of that is through -- all of the different departments have -- there are quite a few departments -- you would be surprised, not just Department of Education, that actually have funding streams for HBCUs, and figuring out how best to streamline that so that more money goes back to the actual colleges and universities. Jennifer. Q: The Pentagon -- that 30-day report yesterday on defeating ISIS. Can you give us any sort of update on the options presented in that and what the President's reaction was? MS. SANDERS: I think the President has been very clear, he never lays out a strategy to defeat an enemy. And that's exactly what he was asked to get back was a strategy and options. And I know that that was presented yesterday. Jim. Q: Did the White House reach out to the Pentagon to see what kind of information could be made public about what intelligence was gathered in that Yemen raid? Do you know if that's something that occurred? MS. SANDERS: I know we've had conversations with people at DOD. I haven't been given specifics, but I do know that very clearly it was stated that there was substantial information gathered that was offered. And I'm trying to figure -- remember exactly how they phrased it -- but actionable items within that information. Sure, go ahead. Q: Just to follow up on immigration, I know you said the focus is still on border security and deporting criminals. But can we expect the President to actually talk about a call for a broader immigration bill at all in the speech? Or is that just something you're saying he's open to but we're not going to hear about it tonight? MS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get in front of the President's speech tonight, but I do think that you can expect immigration to be mentioned. But I'll let him fill you in on the details of what that actually looks like. Q: Two questions. So first, with regard to the anti-ISIS plan, how much of that can we expect to hear from him tonight? You're saying that he doesn't want to kind of reveal the game plan, but it could involve boosting troop numbers perhaps. I mean, the American people probably would want to know something like that. So is there anything that's going to hint to that? The second part is, General McMaster has been reported to say that he didn't think that the phrase ""radical Islamic extremism"" is helpful, is a useful term. So is the President going to try to kind of tone that down in his speech tonight? Or can we expect to still hear that kind of language used? MS. SANDERS: I know that national security will be a big part of the speech tonight. And again, I don't want to get ahead of that, but I think you can certainly anticipate him addressing national security in depth tonight. Zeke. Q: Thanks, Sarah. A follow-up question about the ISIS review. Sean yesterday promised a -- I guess more information today on the process, who was involved in drafting this review -- not specifics of what was in it. And yesterday, the principals committee, when as it actually brought the President? That's the first one.  The second one is, you've spent a lot of time talking about (inaudible) following up on a question earlier. Does the administration hope that the State Department keeps the special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism? Or will the White House sort of commit to keeping that position?  MS. SANDERS: Yeah, on the first question in terms of the plan and the specifics, luckily we're not all the way through with today. And it's going to be a long day, so we've still got plenty of time to get that information to you. In terms of the second part, I'm not clear on the plan for that, but we'll check and get back to you on it. Q: Just two small, short questions. Do you have anything on this immigration -- about the skilled laborers? For example, H-1B visa. Because there is a group of lawmakers who were in Delhi, and they spoke to Prime Minister Modi who gave -- there is a lot of fear about the H-1B visa being slashed. So do you have anything on that? MS. SANDERS: I don't have any announcements on that right now. Q: And the Indian foreign secretary is in town from today until March 4th. Any meetings scheduled here?  MS. SANDERS: Not that I'm aware of right now, but I'll check and we'll get back to you and let you know for sure. Q: Sarah, I was wondering if you have any details on the strike that may have killed Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, the al Qaeda number two? MS. SANDERS: I don't have any comments at all. Not at this time. John Gizzi. Q: Thank you, Sarah. Two brief questions for you. One, in at least two of the televised debates during the Republican presidential nomination, candidate Trump made it clear he was for abolishing the Department of Education. Now he is President, and are there going to be major cutbacks in the Department of Education that have been approved by Secretary DeVos? MS. SANDERS: I'm not sure about specific cutbacks. But I do know that there is a heavy emphasis and priority on moving power away from the federal government to the state and local government. And I know that that was one of the topics that was discussed yesterday with a lot of the governors that were in town. Specifically that topic came up. And I think you can look for ways that we'll start moving power from the federal government to state and local governments where they're closer to education decisions. But as far as specific plans, I couldn't speak to that today. Q: So it's phasing out the department rather than abolishing? MS. SANDERS: I did not say that we were phasing out the department. I said we were moving power away from the federal government to state and local governments. But as far as specifics go, I'm sure we'll be getting to those over the next couple of months. Q: My other question is --  MS. SANDERS: Sean set me up for the take two here. (Laughter.)  Q: The Islamic Resistance Council, one of the best-known groups in opposition to the government in Tehran, recently released documents saying the Quds Force, the Elite Revolutionary Guards in Iran have an extra-territorial division now that is fomenting violence in other countries, including Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. Is the administration aware of this? And does it have any comment on it? MS. SANDERS: That's a question I would refer to the NSC, instead of through us.  Q: In his Fox interview, the President said this morning, ""We will be putting out a replacement plan for Obamacare."" Who is ""we""? MS. SANDERS: Well, I think it's no secret he's been spending a lot of time working with members of Congress, his HHS Secretary, Secretary Price, himself. And again, he's had countless meetings over the first few weeks in office with a lot of people that have major influence and major impact, and that a repeal-and-replace plan would impact a lot. So I think it's a collective thing. But primarily the President, the Department of HHS, and Congress. Q: Will that be one plan? Or is it going to be a White House plan and a congressional plan?  MS. SANDERS: I don't think we're ready to make that full announcement today, but I definitely know that it's a collective process that we've been working through. Jim. Q: Just to follow up on that question: Has there been some warmth shown to the Speaker's office and to the House Republican proposal? That's what we're hearing from sources up on the Hill, that they're feeling a little bit better about the way the President is receiving their proposals for repealing and replacing Obamacare. MS. SANDERS: Look, we -- absolutely, this President is very clear he wants to work with Congress. And we want to make sure that we have the best plan possible. And I think that requires that all of us come together and work together to make sure we get that. And that's exactly what we've been doing. Q: Can I just follow on that, Sarah? There are a variety of House Republicans who know that the working draft is dead in the House -- among Republicans for ACA repeal and replace. And their question is whether they're going to hear from the President something more specific that will help give them cover and lead them forward on ACA, publicly. So my question to you is: What is he going to say that might be in the vein that they're talking about -- leading, giving them cover, and describing something in more detail than Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced?  MS. SANDERS: Again, I'm not going to get ahead of the President's speech tonight. But I do know that he will address Obamacare. He'll talk about some of his priorities for the plan, and I'll let him speak to that later this evening. Q: Can I also ask -- Sean said yesterday we could expect a new immigration, travel EO by midweek. Is that still operable? MS. SANDERS: I would say that's pretty likely.  Francesca. Q: Thank you, Sarah. The White House, I'm wondering, if you have a strategy for who is sitting with the President -- or rather with the First Lady in the box -- for instance, Democrats are purposefully bringing DREAMers, they're purposefully brining Muslims to show their opposition to some of the President's strategy. So what is the White House's message with the people that are sitting in the President's box? MS. SANDERS: I think the primary reason that a lot of times you have people in the box are they're -- that highlight specific parts of the speech and specific parts of the agenda. And I think you can see the people sitting with him. It's pretty obvious the reason that most of them are there. And he's laid out those priorities since day one of his administration. And so I think it's pretty self-explanatory there, Francesca. Jordan. Q: Thanks, Sarah. The President's budget -- even though it's not complete yet -- has already been running into some significant resistance among Senate Republicans. Senator McConnell is out there criticizing the State Department cuts. Senator Graham said it was dead on arrival. So I just want to know what the White House is doing to talk to these members, maybe assuage their concerns. Can you give us a picture what's going on behind the scenes to get support for that document before it comes out? MS. SANDERS: Sure. I mean, the President met with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell earlier this week to talk about some of those priorities. But again, this isn't a final budget. It's a draft, and the whole point of it is to receive feedback, work together, and put the best budget forward possible. And that's exactly what process we're in right now. Director Mulvaney is focused on doing that. And I know he's got a lot of colleagues in the House and Senate, and he'll be speaking with a lot of those people over the coming weeks as we lead up to rolling out our budget.  Q: Sarah, the President said he believes that former President Barack Obama is secretly behind these waves of protests that have been coming up these last few weeks. What tangible evidence is President Trump basing this on? And when was the last time the two spoke? MS. SANDERS: I'll let the President's comments on that stand for itself. And I'm not sure on the last time they spoke. I'd have to check on that and get back to you. Q: But does the White House believe that President Obama and his people -- like the President is suggesting -- are behind these protests? MS. SANDERS: Look, I think the bottom line here is that we've all condemned the protests. I think that that's the bigger story here. And the focus that we should be talking about is that this isn't something that helps and moves us forward. And that's what we're focused on right now. Q: Two questions -- one is on immigration.  MS. SANDERS: The topic of the day. Q: In 2014, President Trump, then-citizen Trump, spoke to CPAC and said that he thought immigration in the long term, if there was an immigration reform bill, that it would be a loser for the Republican Party; that the people who could be naturalized through the process would only vote for Democrats. Has the President come to a different political calculation that if there is a pathway to citizenship for people here illegally, that they could eventually vote for Republicans? MS. SANDERS: Again, I haven't had the chance to talk with the President about this specific policy that we've now asked about multiple times. But we'll try to do that and get something to you guys in the next --  Q: Does the President think that human exploration is something that is important for the -- human space exploration is something that's important for the country to invest in, in the future? MS. SANDERS: I'm not sure if I would say that it's a top priority. But I know it's something that's certainly been discussed. Thanks, guys. We look forward to the speech tonight, and we'll get you some more details. Q: (Inaudible) tonight? Hopefully we'll have some more information to lay out for you guys later this afternoon. Thanks.

"Donald J. Trump: Press Gaggle by National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster",2017-07-08,"7:00 P.M. CET MR. COHN: So we're going to divide up the labors here. Q: Just for the purpose of people back home, can you say your name before your speak? MR. COHN: Okay, sure. I'm Gary Cohn. Secretary Mnuchin and General McMaster, we're going to be diving up the duties here. I'm going to be talking about the G20 in itself. General McMaster and Secretary Mnuchin will be talking about all of the bilaterals and all of the meetings with heads of state that we had over the last three days, including going back into Poland and the Three Seas meetings as well. So if you add them all up, probably 20 individual meetings with different countries over the last three days on the trip. I'll first touch quickly on the G20. I think as you know, we had a very rigorous schedule for the President, and he made it more rigorous on himself by adding a few more extra meetings, which the Secretary will touch on. The G20 schedule, as you know, that we went through in the prior press conference, talked on some of the major topics that we were quite interested in. The President took the opportunity to deliver speeches in each of the sections. The first section was the private leaders section on terrorism, where the President delivered his thoughts on terrorism, global terrorism, what's going on in terrorism around the world, and terrorism financing.  The Secretary would be happy to talk to you about what he's doing on fighting terrorism and terrorism financing and sanctions. We've become more aggressive on what we're doing there and trying to cut off funding to terrorism around the world. The global leaders as a whole were in consensus, in uniform thoughts on what's going on in the fight of terrorism around the world. The second section, where the President also led off and spoke and delivered a speech on trade and finance. The President talked about what's going on in the U.S. economy; talked about the job creation, the job data out on Friday; talked about the 860,000-plus jobs since the inauguration; and talked about the stock market reforms and what's going on here, and how we're doing in the economy but how we've got to get our trade and our trade numbers better, and our trade imbalance, and how we've got deficits with most of the countries -- most of the countries around the table.  He talked about the trade deficit. He talked about nearly $800 billion of trade deficits and goods for the United States last year alone. He talked about how he wants to rectify that and how we're going to fight to level the playing field on trade and climate. So he delivered that speech to the group there.  Then we had section on migration, where the President delivered another speech a little bit later in the queue -- we went later in the queue on migration -- where the President talked about our views on migration, where he was looking at how he thought the world should look at migration. We should not promote the downward spiral of migration. We don't want to see mass migration out of any country. We should see countries looking to build their own economies and keep their residence in their countries, and keep their citizens in their countries, and make their countries better places for their citizens. He does believe in migration, but migration for the right reasons, and did not want to see massive migration. Today, I think you know, we started the day off by him going to the -- let me get my speeches here so I can -- the launch of the women's entrepreneurial financial initiative with the World Bank, where he announced our $50 million contribution, where he was onstage with Ivanka talking about what we are doing with the World Bank. And Dina down here, as well, was heavily involved. She's hiding. So we and many other countries were on the stage talking about the $300 million-plus contribution of the World Bank fund that they're going to leverage into billions of dollars to help women and women entrepreneurs, and women build businesses around the world. So that was the first thing we did this morning. And then, of course, that led into the G20 forum on digitization and women's empowerment and women's employment. Again, the President gave a speech in there where we talked about the role of women in the world. We talked about the role of women in the economies and empowering women, where, again, he mentioned what we did this morning. He mentioned how his administration cares about women, empower women as a priority, including access to capital, mentoring and networking, and skills training, which fits into what we did a couple weeks ago in our employment week. We talked about worker training and all of those things.  So he continues to support the G20's effort to increase voluntary participation of women in the labor force and eliminate barriers that prevent women from achieving economic aspirations. That was his speech this morning that we talked about in women's empowerment. And then, later this afternoon, we talked about what was going on in the final session, which I'm drawing a blank on right now. What was the final session this afternoon? MS. POWELL: The women's session -- the women one. That was the final session. It was the final one. MR. COHN: Yeah, that was the final. Okay, women was the final session. Then we had our closing session where there was the natural handoff from Germany to Argentina for the next year's G20. The President was quite active, quite involved in the roundtable discussions. He was very, very complimentary of Angela Merkel, the Chancellor, in the way that she ran the G20 and the participation of everyone around the table. If you have any questions on the G20, I'm happy to take them. If not, my two colleagues to the right will talk about the bilateral meetings. Q: Can I ask, how hard did you have to work to get the final communiquй to make sure that you didn't look like you were too isolated on things like climate? And how much of a fig leaf is it that you've managed to get wording to that effect? MR. COHN: I actually thought the communication came together pretty -- I don't want to say easily -- these things are never easy. To get 20 of your friends to agree where to have dinner together tonight is really hard. But I thought the communiquй came together pretty reasonably. There's a diversity of opinions in a group of 20, so there's people on every side of the issue. So it was never a situation where there was an isolated force there.  Obviously, the communication says -- so you can see it in there -- that we had chosen to get out of the Paris Agreement. So we were -- but everyone accepted that very early that we chose to get out of the Paris Agreement, but we do go out of our way to say in there that that doesn't mean that we don't support environment, and we're still working for the environment. If you look at what we've achieved environmentally in the United States, our numbers are pretty good. So there was not -- it was not a situation where there was contentious discussion going on. SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I would just say on the communiquй and if you look at how far we've come since the original G20 finance ministers meeting where we had one sentence on trade -- and I think as you all know, it was kind of 19 to 1, me being the one -- here, I think the trade paragraph has enormous substance to it. It incorporates the concept of reciprocal and fair trade. And I think there was a real focus on dumping and other issues on steel. I think there was an incredible consensus, and now it's many months later. But anyway, why don't I do this -- why don't I just talk briefly about the bilats and then we'll take questions on anything you guys want. So this was the President's second trip abroad. I think that a major focus of the trip was not just participating in the G20, but was very substantive -- they were very, very substantive bilats. And Secretary Tillerson joined us on the trip, in Hamburg specifically, to participate in the bilats.  I think as you know, we started in Poland with two bilats in Poland and then participating in the Three Seas with another 10 leaders. President Trump participated in that meeting, which was very substantive, and listened to each one of those leaders as they had different views.  We then came to Germany, where there were 10 -- there were another eight bilats here. There were three pull-asides on top of that. The bilats were very, very substantive discussions. These were not just relationship builders. These were very focused on economic issues, trade issues, security issues, North Korea.  I think as you know, we had a very significant trilat dinner with Prime Minister Abe and President Moon, where the focus was clearly North Korea and what we were going to do about North Korea.  The other two most substantive bilats were obviously the Russian bilat with President Putin, which started out with the intention of being a half an hour, and went for over two hours. We had another very substantive bilat today with President Xi of China, which lasted over an hour and a half, and would have lasted longer if we didn't have to get pulled out to leave, since we had a time issue. But these were very substantive issues.  In regards to China, we had very direct discussions about North Korea. We had very direct discussions about military and security cooperation. And we had very direct discussions about the comprehensive economic dialogue, which we'll be following up with a meeting in July, in D.C. So these were very, very, substantive discussions. MR. COHN: Let me add something. The three of us have been in, I would say, basically all of the President's bilats since day one. The relationships that -- Q: (Inaudible.) MR. COHN: What was it? Q: (Inaudible) one.  MR. COHN: I said basically all. The relationships that he's building and the comradery that he has is just extraordinary. I mean, you can see the personal relationship he has with Xi and Abe and all these people. The warmness and the openness that's going on between the two of them, it's really extraordinary. Q: Just to follow up on that, and to what Andrew asked about -- MR. MNUCHIN: (Inaudible) on Merkel, okay? Whatever original discussions there were, that was one of the most substantive meetings where it was very clear that the President addressed issues of trade very directly. Merkel was very direct. It could not have gone better. I think it was very clear we're on the same page on almost every issue. And whether it was Theresa May, where obviously it's the U.S.'s most substantial ally -- I mean, these were very substantive discussions where the President was brilliant and had a command of these discussions and the issues. Q: Can you talk specifically about the meeting with President Xi? In his public remarks, the President was complimentary of President Xi and what he's done on the issue of North Korea. But we know he has also said that he is frustrated that China hasn't done more. So did he voice that in private? Or can you characterize at all what their discussion was with regard to how to respond to the latest -- SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think the discussion was very direct. So it started with a -- again, this was an hour-and-a-half meeting with a very large component of it focused on North Korea. And I think we had substantive discussions about -- for the financing of North Korea. We had substantive discussions about ways of dealing with North Korea together.  And I think that President Trump made very clear to President Xi that he is focused on this issue, and wants to move forward and make progress. And I think President Xi gave a very interesting perspective from their standpoint. So I think it was very predominantly about -- Q: Did he ask (inaudible) -- MR. SPICER: I'm want to get McMaster in here. Let's do that, and then we can keep going.  General. GENERAL MCMASTER: Okay. All right, first, I just wanted to remind everybody that the President's second overseas trip began in Poland, where he attended a Three Seas Conference with 12 heads of state from central and southern Europe. It was an extremely successful exchange of views and perspectives there. And you really got to see the three main objectives that the President gave us to structure this trip being met from the very beginning of the trip, which is promote American prosperity, protect American interests, and provide American leadership. And you saw the overlap between defense and security cooperation with energy security, and the role the United States can play in ensuring that those nations are not dependent on any one source of energy and are not then susceptible to the kind of coercion associated with that single source of energy. He also saw how those nations really want American leadership -- really want America to be engaged in that part of the world. And what the President was able to do there, and in his meetings with President Duda and the Polish leadership, is really reaffirm America's leadership, commitment to our allies, and to NATO in particular. And the very powerful speech that he gave I think is a great example of the overlap between those three objectives of prosperity, protecting our interests, and providing American leadership. I think what is really important is I think you can see with the President's engagement is the advancing of American influence and leadership, and a recognition -- by us, by everyone -- that America First doesn't mean that the rest of the world last. America First doesn't mean America alone. And it means that peace, prosperity, and the rule of law are the surest guarantors of liberty, both at home and abroad. And that speech in Poland -- I would just ask you to go back to that text to see the overlap between those three objectives. The President reiterated his commitment to mutual support and defense through NATO, and he gave a stirring affirmation of our values and why it's important for us to understand who we are, and to be determined to protect our values. He talked through the historical lens of the Polish experience to emphasize what we need to do today to defeat the enemies of all civilized people represented by these terrorist organizations that use a perverted interpretation of religion to foment hatred and justify violence. And throughout the trip, throughout his engagements with leaders -- as Secretary Mnuchin already mentioned -- the President emphasized the need to deny safe havens and support bases for terrorist organizations, and talked about ongoing operations with our allies and partners to do that in the defeat-ISIS campaign in places like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. He then also, though, emphasized again the need to cut off funding not only for terrorist organizations but also to those who propagate this extremist ideology that continues to fuel this problem and bring people into these organizations, and then, of course, to combat the ideology itself. And so that was a theme in almost all of the bilateral engagements as well as the beginning of the trip in Poland. You have the list of all the bilateral engagements. We're happy to answer any questions you have. But I think what you saw is that America First means building coalitions -- building coalitions especially with those whose interests overlap with ours. And what you saw is really a high degree of common understanding of not just problems that we're facing, but also opportunities that we can take advantage of.  And each of these meetings, each of these engagements with leaders advanced American interests in the areas of our security and American prosperity. And we can cover lots of specifics on that if you'd like as well. And then, of course, there's a recognition that the United States benefits when our allies and partners are stronger, and when burdens and responsibilities can be shared and shouldered more equitably. And so what you've seen is a very big emphasis on defense cooperation and a desire for us to have interoperable capabilities with our allies. And that was a big defense cooperation theme throughout all the engagements in Poland and in the G20 as well. Q: General McMaster, Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov walked out of that bilat yesterday and went out, and they told people that President Trump had accepted their denial of election interference. Is that true? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Let me just say, first of all, I think President Trump handled the meeting brilliantly, okay? It was very clear what started as a 30-minute meeting -- and President Trump made it very clear in addressing the issues around the election. After a very substantive discussion on this, they reached an agreement that they would start a cyber unit to make sure that there was absolutely no interference whatsoever, that they would work on cybersecurity together. And President Trump focused the conversation on Syria and the Ukraine and North Korea. And I think it's very important that President Trump had a very substantive dialogue with his counterpart on this. And it is very clear that there are many issues we need to open a dialogue on. And I think President Trump handled it brilliantly. Q: General McMaster, can you address not the question of how President Trump handled it, but the question of how Putin and Lavrov have handled it. What are you going to do about it? I mean, it's not true, is it, that President Trump accepted Putin's statement? GENERAL MCMASTER: What the President and Secretary Tillerson charged us with as they came out of the meeting is what we're going to do going forward. Secretary Mnuchin mentioned one of those aspects already, which is a recognition of the importance of cybersecurity and the need to make sure that we protect election systems in the United States and in Europe and elsewhere. So that is one of the things we're going to focus on going forward. But I think the most important thing, from my perspective anyway, coming out of the meeting, is the importance of having a bilateral relationship with Russia so we can work on problems together. And so as Secretary Mnuchin mentioned, and as Secretary Tillerson mentioned already, it was a wide-ranging, substantive discussion. No problems were solved. Nobody expected any problems to be solved in that meeting. But it was a beginning of a dialogue on some tough problem sets that we'll begin now to work on together. And you saw the beginnings of that with the work that Secretary Tillerson has done with the Russians on Syria. It's the very beginning of attempting to get to some degree of stability in a portion of Syria to begin to get to an outcome there that ends the humanitarian suffering there and begins to bridge toward enduring political settlements in at least parts of that troubled country and for that long-suffering population. So you see the beginning of working together in these areas. Q: But you have the President of another country making a statement about the President of the United States. Do you not want to respond to that and correct the record if it is wrong? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: You know, we're not going to make comments about what other people say. President Trump will be happy to make statements himself about that. But President Trump handled himself brilliantly. It was very clear he made his position felt. And after very substantive dialogue on this, they agreed to move on to other discussions. And I think it's very clear that they've opened a dialogue, that it's important to have a dialogue.  As we've said, they focused on a ceasefire on Syria, focused on making sure that we have a cyber unit to make sure that Russia and nobody else interferes in any democratic elections. And we focused on the issue of North Korea, which is a major concern to us and all our other allies. Q: Why did you decide to raise it anyway, though? There seemed to be a debate, sort of, in the days leading up to the meeting: ""Would he raise it? Would he not raise it?"" Why did he decide to sort of raise it at all? Was that essential, do you think, to start that dialogue? Or why did he decide -- SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think it was obvious that it was an issue, and President Trump was going to bring it up and raise it. He wasn't afraid of it. He addressed it head on, and then they moved on to other issues. Q: How do you develop an atmosphere of trust and working together on all these important issues that you just laid out when the two sides can't even agree on what happened in that conversation in the first face-to-face meeting? I mean -- SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I think it's very clear that there's lots of things that we need to work on with them. And there's a commitment to move forward, work on issues that we can work on together. And I think the Syria ceasefire is a major, major success. If we can have a ceasefire and focus on how we work on Syria, and build a cyber unit, and be committed to make sure that nobody ever interferes in democratic elections again, that is a major accomplishment that President Trump is focused on. Q: Did the issue of Russia's properties in Maryland that the U.S. confiscated come up? And how did President Trump respond? SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I'm not aware of that coming up. I got debriefed on the meeting and didn't hear anything about that. So it may have, but I don't know. Q: One follow-up to Gary on the question of the G20 and climate change. We understand there was some tension with President Macron over climate. Can you describe what happened there? And can you also look forward to this upcoming trip to Paris and describe the relationship and what he wants to do there between Macron and Trump? MR. COHN: Look, there's a debate on climate -- from your question. But I think the President -- I'll read you two -- I think the section I left out before was climate. So I'll read you two sentences out of the President's speech. You know, he says: The United States believes that responsible economic development and economic stewardship are essential priorities of all nations. Indeed, these are globally complementary. And then the President goes: Honestly, the United States develops all of our domestic energy resources, including oil, clean coal, natural gas, nuclear power renewables, while at the same time reducing emissions, protecting natural habitats, and ensuring truly clean air and clean water. So the President clearly believes in the environment. He talked about it here. You know, Macron and the President have somewhat different views on how to achieve the end goal, but I think the end goal is the same. And they were debating how to achieve the end goal. Q: And what about the broader relationship between those two men ahead of the Paris trip? MR. COHN: Their relationship is great. I mean, they had two different pull-asides. Macron personally called the President and invited him, and asked him to come to the 100th anniversary of Bastille Day next week. The President is going to Paris next week. GENERAL MCMASTER: It's Bastille Day and the 100th anniversary of the entry of American troops into World War I. Sorry, sir. MR. COHN: Thank you. Thank you, General. (Laughter.) Q: But what does he want to achieve on that trip? MR. COHN: We are scheduled already. The schedule is determined. We'll probably tell you guys what it is next week. But it's going to have a couple official meetings mostly around, I would say, security and military meetings, as well as a long bilateral between the two. SECRETARY MNUCHIN: All right. I think we're going to cut it off at this point. Q: No, don't cut it off. Q: No, that's not fair. Seriously, that's not very long. Q: What about Erdogan? What about the Erdogan meeting? MS. SANDERS: It was 27 minutes. Q: Twenty of it was not Q: and A. END 7:25 P.M. CET",NA
"Donald J. Trump: Remarks at the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, DC",2016-03-21,"In 2001, weeks after the attacks on New York City and on Washington and frankly, the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the Islamic fundamentalists, Mayor Rudy Giuliani visited Israel to show solidarity with terror victims. I sent my plane, because I backed the mission for Israel 100 percent. In spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the Gaza Strip, I was the grand marshal of the 40th Salute to Israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the Jewish state. It was a very dangerous time for Israel, and frankly, for anyone supporting Israel. Many people turned down this honor; I did not. I took the risk and I'm glad I did. But I didn't come here tonight to pander to you about Israel. That's what politicians do, all talk, no action, believe me. I came here to speak to you about where I stand on the future of American relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother, the only democracy in the Middle East, the State of Israel. Thank you. My number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran. Thank you. I have been in business a long time, I know deal making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic for America, for Israel and for the whole of the Middle East. The problem here is fundamental. We've rewarded the world's leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion dollars and we received absolutely nothing in return. I've studied this issue in great detail. I would say, actually, greater by far than anybody else, believe me, oh, believe me. And it's a bad deal. The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already as you know, it has. The bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. And of course, they'll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them. The deal doesn't even require Iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years, but when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is. Terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially Israel. When I'm president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran. First, we will stand up to Iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. Iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if I'm not elected president, I know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that's why I'm going to be elected president, folks. And we are leading in every poll, remember that, please. Iran is a problem in Iraq, a problem in Syria, a problem in Lebanon, a problem in Yemen and will be a very, very major problem for Saudi Arabia. Literally, every day Iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states, Hezbollah, Lebanon received, and I'll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons and GPS systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have. Now they're in Syria trying to establish another front against Israel from the Syrian side of the Golan Heights. In Gaza, Iran is supporting Hamas, and Islamic Jihad. And in the West Bank, they're openly offering Palestinians 7,000 dollars per terror attack and 30,000 dollars for every Palestinian terrorist home that's been destroyed, a deplorable, deplorable situation. Iran is financing military forces throughout the Middle East and it's absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion dollars to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror. Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran's global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us. Iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. During the last five years, Iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. They've got terror cells everywhere, including in the Western Hemisphere very close to home. Iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me. Third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold Iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you've never seen a contract enforced before, folks, believe me. Iran has already, since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. Those ballistic missiles, with a range of 1,250 miles, were designed to intimidate not only Israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten Europe and someday maybe hit even the United States and we're not going to let that happen, we're not letting it happen and we're not letting it happen to Israel, believe me. Thank you. Do you want to hear something really shocking? As many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both Hebrew and Farsi were the words ""Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth."" You can forget that. What kind of demented minds write that in Hebrew? And here's another. You talk about twisted, here's another twisted part. Testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we've made. The deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The problem is, no one has done anything about it. We will, I promise, we will. Thank you. Which brings me to my next point, the utter weakness and incompetence of the United Nations. The United Nations is not a friend of democracy, it's not a friend to freedom, it's not a friend even to the United States of America; whereas you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to Israel. With President Obama, in his final year, yay, he may be the worst thing to ever happen to Israel, believe me, believe me, and you know it better than anybody. So with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between Israel and Palestine. Let me be clear, an agreement imposed by the United Nations would be a total and complete disaster. The United States must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which I will use as president 100 percent. When people ask why, it's because that's not how you make a deal. Deals are made when parties come together, they come to a table and they negotiate. Each side must give up something, its values. I mean, we have to do something where there's value in exchange for something that it requires. That's what a deal is. A deal is really something that when we impose it on Israel and Palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. That's not going to happen with the United Nations. It will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize Israel. It will be a catastrophe and a disaster for Israel. It's not going to happen, folks. And further, it would reward Palestinian terrorism, because every day they're stabbing Israelis and even Americans. Just last week, American Taylor Allen Force, a West Point grad, phenomenal young person who served in Iraq and Afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding Palestinian. You don't reward behavior like that. You cannot do it. There's only one way you treat that kind of behavior. You have to confront it. So it's not up to the United Nations to really go with a solution. It's really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. They have no choice, they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway. The United States can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling Israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don't even really know what's happening to Israel, to anything in the area. It's so preposterous. We're not going to let that happen. When I'm president, believe me, I will veto any attempt by the U.N. to impose its will on the Jewish state. It will be vetoed 100 percent. You see, I know about deal making, that's what I do. I wrote the Art of the Deal. One of the bestselling all-time, and I mean, seriously, I'm saying ""one of,"" because I'll be criticized if I say ""the,"" so I'm going to be very diplomatic, ""one of,"" I'll be criticized, I think it is number one, but why take a chance. One of the all-time bestselling books about deals and deal making. To make a great deal, you need two willing participants. We know Israel is willing to deal. Israel has been trying. That's right. Israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. You had Camp David in 2000 where Prime Minister Barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous; Arafat rejected it. In 2008, Prime Minister Olmert made an equally generous offer; the Palestinian Authority rejected it also. Then John Kerry tried to come up with the framework and Abbas didn't even respond, not even to the Secretary of State of the United States of America. They didn't even respond. When I become president, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one. Thank you. And when I say something, I mean it. I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and we'll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region. Meanwhile, every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate Israel and to hate the Jews. It has to stop. When you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes, little kids want to be firefighters. When you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. In Palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder Jews. We can't let this continue. We can't let this happen any longer. You cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. Glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. It is a horrible way to think. It's a barrier that can't be broken. That will end and it'll end soon, believe me. In Palestinian textbooks and mosques, you've got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace, they've got to go out and they've got to start [sic] this educational process. They have to end education of hatred. They have to end it and now. There is no moral equivalency. Israel does not name public squares after terrorists. Israel does not pay its children to stab random Palestinians. You see, what President Obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies. And you see that happening all the time, that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who is a total disaster, by the way. She and President Obama have treated Israel very, very badly. But it's repeated itself over and over again and it's done nothing to embolden those who hate America. We saw that with releasing the 150 billion dollars to Iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. It didn't happen. President Obama thinks that applying pressure to Israel will force the issue, but it's precisely the opposite that happens. Already half of the population of Palestine has been taken over by the Palestinian ISIS in Hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half. So it's a very difficult situation that's never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the United States. We'll get it solved one way or the other. We will get it solved. But when the United States stands with Israel, the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially. That's what will happen when Donald Trump is president of the United States. We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. And we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between America and our most reliable ally, the State of Israel. The Palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the United States and Israel is absolutely totally unbreakable. They must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against Israel. They must do that. And they must come to the table willing to accept that Israel is a Jewish state and it will forever exist as a Jewish state. I love the people in this room. I love Israel. I love Israel. I've been with Israel so long in terms of I've received some of my greatest honors from Israel; my father before me, incredible. My daughter Ivanka is about to have a beautiful Jewish baby. In fact, it could be happening right now, which would be very nice as far as I'm concerned. So I want to thank you very much, this has been a truly great honor. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you very much.",NA
"Donald J. Trump: Remarks at the Washington County Fair Park in West Bend, Wisconsin",2016-08-16,"We are at a decisive moment in this election. Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country. Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism. Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.  Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times. The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace. Law and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities. The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods. It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result. There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration. The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one. The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police. More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs. Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it. Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country. They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America. Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives – whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore – and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities. During the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded. More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama's hometown area since his presidency began. How are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers? The war on our police must end. It must end now. The war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety. Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor. Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school. For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night. My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim. Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities. I care too much about my country to let that happen. We all care too much about our country to let that happen. Good policing saves lives. My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this. The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent. Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed. Imagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn't blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City? I'll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country. It's easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force. I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security. Hillary Clinton has had her chance. She failed. Now it's time for new leadership. The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most. There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people. It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American – and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time. I am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future. It is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths. The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community. Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty. Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade. Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings. 18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims. The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average. Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job. Nearly four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty. 55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it's one of the worst public school systems in the country. 1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit. To every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future. The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted. They've just assumed they'll get your support and done nothing in return for it. It's time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it's time to rebuild the inner cities of America – and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system. I'm not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me. I've been paying my own way. The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system. The other party – the Democratic Party – nominated the personification of special interest corruption. The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests. I am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help. The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard. Jobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation. We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future. She doesn't care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them. The African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party. It's time to break with the failures of the past – I want to offer Americans a new future. It is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests. Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton. The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class. It's the powerful protecting the powerful. Insiders fighting for insiders. I am fighting for you. When we talk about the insider, who are we talking about? It's the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests. It's the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill. It's the financial industry that knows how to regulate their competition out of existence. The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change. Every day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and you hear about some self-interest banker or some discredited Washington insider says they oppose our campaign. Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign. Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign. I wear their opposition as a badge of honor. Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change. I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country. The media-donor-political complex that's bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people. The leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country. I am going to give the people their voice back. Think about it. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another. Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense? Aren't you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard? Are you ready for change? Are you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first? Let's talk about what this means for the inner cities of America. It's time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests. I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system – a lot of people who've created our problems – will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign. It's time to stop making the special interests rich. It's time to make the American people rich. I am going to Make America Wealthy again. The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin. They've ruined the schools. They've driven out the jobs. They've tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable. Violent crime has risen 17% in America's 50 largest cities last year. Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent. Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C. This is the future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same. The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine. It is time for a different future. Here is what I am proposing. First, on immigration. No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton's immigration policies than the African-American community. Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans. I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people. On trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job. On taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores – and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave. I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee. Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States. On education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first. Hillary Clinton would rather deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy. I am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job. On crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods. To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end. On healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare – which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases – and give choice to patients and consumers. Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out – as are many of the major insurance companies. On government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government. We've seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense. We've seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government. In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law. I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve. I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning. We are going to make this a government of the people once again. This is our chance to take back power from all the people who've taken it from you. The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community. These are tough times. But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before. To do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House. I will be your fighter. To defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina. Hillary Clinton doesn't have that strength and stamina. She cannot win for you. Most importantly, she has bad judgment. Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade. The only individuals she's ever delivered for is her donors – not the people. I've said it before, and I'll say it again. My opponent asks her supporters to repeat a three-word pledge. Her pledge reads: ""I'm With Her"" I choose to recite a different pledge. My pledge reads: ""I'm With You – the American people."" I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people. I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House. We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success. To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I'm with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you. Together, We will make America strong again. We will make American safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, and God Bless.",NA
Donald J. Trump: The President's News Conference With Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel,2017-02-15,"The State of Israel is a symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression—I can think of no other state that's gone through what they've gone—and of survival in the face of genocide. We will never forget what the Jewish people have endured.  Your perseverance in the face of hostility, your open democracy in the face of violence, and your success in the face of tall odds, is truly inspirational. The security challenges faced by Israel are enormous, including the threat of Iran's nuclear ambitions, which I've talked a lot about. One of the worst deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal. My administration has already imposed new sanctions on Iran, and I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing—I mean ever—a nuclear weapon.  Our security assistance to Israel is currently at an alltime high, ensuring that Israel has the ability to defend itself from threats of which there are unfortunately many. Both of our countries will continue and grow. We have a long history of cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the fight against those who do not value human life. America and Israel are two nations that cherish the value of all human life.  This is one more reason why we reject unfair and one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations—just treated Israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly—or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel. Our administration is committed to working with Israel and our common allies in the region towards greater security and stability. That includes working toward a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The United States will encourage a peace and, really, a great peace deal. We'll be working on it very, very diligently. Very important to me also, something we want to do. But it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement. We'll be beside them; we'll be working with them.  As with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises. You know that, right? [Laughter]  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Both sides.  President Trump. I want the Israeli people to know that the United States stands with Israel in the struggle against terrorism. As you know, Mr. Prime Minister, our two nations will always condemn terrorist acts. Peace requires nations to uphold the dignity of human life and to be a voice for all of those who are endangered and forgotten.  Those are the ideals to which we all—and will always—aspire and commit. This will be the first of many productive meetings. And I, again, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with us today.  Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. Prime Minister Netanyahu. President Trump, thank you for the truly warm hospitality you and Melania have shown me, my wife Sara, our entire delegation. I deeply value your friendship. To me, to the State of Israel, it was so clearly evident in the words you just spoke: Israel has no better ally than the United States. And I want to assure you, the United States has no better ally than Israel.  Our alliance has been remarkably strong, but under your leadership, I'm confident it will get even stronger. I look forward to working with you to dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field: in security, in technology, in cyber and trade and so many others. And I certainly welcome your forthright call to ensure that Israel is treated fairly in international forums and that the slander and boycotts of Israel are resisted mightily by the power and moral position of the United States of America.  As you have said, our alliance is based on a deep bond of common values and common interests. And increasingly, those values and interests are under attack by one malevolent force: radical Islamic terror. Mr. President, you've shown great clarity and courage in confronting this challenge head on. You call for confronting Iran's terrorist regime, preventing Iran from realizing this terrible deal into a nuclear arsenal. And you have said that the United States is committed to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons. You call for the defeat of ISIS. Under your leadership, I believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical Islam. And in this great task, as in so many others, Israel stands with you, and I stand with you.  Mr. President, in rolling back militant Islam, we can seize an historic opportunity, because for the first time in my lifetime, and for the first time in the life of my country, Arab countries in the region do not see Israel as an enemy, but increasingly, as an ally. And I believe that under your leadership, this change in our region creates an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen security and advance peace.  Let us seize this moment together. Let us bolster security. Let us seek new avenues of peace. And let us bring the remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States to even greater heights.  Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.  President Trump. Thank you. Again, thank you.  We'll take a couple of questions. David Brody, that's Christian Broadcasting. David.  Former National Security Adviser Michael T. Flynn/Israel's West Bank Settlement Policy/Arab-Israeli Peace Process  Q. Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. Both of you have criticized the Iran nuclear deal and at times even called for its repeal. I'm wondering if you're concerned at all as it relates to not just the National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, who is recently no longer here, but also some of those events that have been going on with communication in Russia—if that is going to hamper this deal at all, and whether or not it would keep Iran from becoming a nuclear state.  And secondly, on the settlement issue, are you both on the same page? How do you exactly term that, as it relates to the settlement issue? Thank you.  President Trump. Michael Flynn, General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think he's been treated very, very unfairly by the media, as I call it, the fake media, in many cases. And I think it's really a sad thing that he was treated so badly. I think, in addition to that, from intelligence—papers are being leaked, things are being leaked. It's criminal action, criminal act, and it's been going on for a long time, before me. But now it's really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton.  I think it's very, very unfair what's happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally—I stress that—illegally leaked. Very, very unfair.  As far as settlements, I'd like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. We'll work something out. But I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made. I know that every President would like to. Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. And it wasn't possible, because they didn't do it.  But Bibi and I have known each other a long time, a smart man, great negotiator. And I think we're going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility. So let's see what we do.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Let's try it.  President Trump. Doesn't sound too optimistic, but that's—[laughter]. He's a good negotiator.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. That's the ""art of the deal."" [Laughter]  President Trump. I also want to thank—I also want to thank—Sara, could you please stand up? You're so lovely and you've been so nice to Melania. I appreciate it very much. Thank you.  Your turn.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Who is it? [Inaudible]—yes, please. Go ahead.  Arab-Israeli Peace Process/Location of U.S. Embassy in Israel  Q. Thank you very much. Mr. President, in your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up of the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration? And will you be willing to hear different ideas from the Prime Minister, as some of his partners are asking him to do, for example, annexation of parts of the West Bank and unrestricted settlement constructions? And one more question: Are you going to fulfill your promise to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem? And if so, when?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, did you come here tonight to tell the President that you're backing off the two-state solution?  Thank you.  President Trump. So I'm looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like. [Laughter] I'm very happy with the one that both parties like. I can live with either one. I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two. But honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians—if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, I'm happy with the one they like the best.  As far as the Embassy moving to Jerusalem, I'd love to see that happen. We're looking at it very, very strongly. We're looking at it with great care—great care, believe me. And we'll see what happens. Okay?  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you. I read yesterday that an American official said that if you ask five people what two states would look like, you'd get eight different answers. Well, Mr. President, if you ask five Israelis, you'd get 12 different answers. [Laughter]  But rather than deal with labels, I want to deal with substance. It's something I've hoped to do for years in a world that's absolutely fixated on labels and not on substance. So here's the substance: There are two prerequisites for peace that I laid out 2 years—several years ago, and they haven't changed.  First, the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state. They have to stop calling for Israel's destruction. They have to stop educating their people for Israel's destruction.  Second, in any peace agreement, Israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River. Because if we don't, we know what will happen—because otherwise, we'll get another radical Islamic, terrorist state in the Palestinian areas exploding the peace, exploding the Middle East.  Now, unfortunately, the Palestinians vehemently reject both prerequisites for peace. First, they continue to call for Israel's destruction: inside their schools, inside their mosques, inside the textbooks. You have to read it to believe it.  They even deny, Mr. President, our historical connection to our homeland. And I suppose you have to ask yourself: Why do—why are Jews called Jews? Well, the Chinese are called Chinese because they come from China. The Japanese are called Japanese because they come from Japan. Well, Jews are called Jews because they come from Judea. This is our ancestral homeland. Jews are not foreign colonialists in Judea.  So, unfortunately, the Palestinians not only deny the past, they also poison the present. They name public squares in honor of mass murderers who murdered Israelis and, I have to say, also murdered Americans. They fund—they pay monthly salaries to the families of murderers, like the family of the terrorist who killed Taylor Force, a wonderful young American, a West Point graduate, who was stabbed to death while visiting Israel.  So this is the source of the conflict, the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state in any boundary, this persistent rejectionism. That's the reason we don't have peace. Now, that has to change. I want it to change. Not only have I not abandoned these two prerequisites of peace; they've become even more important because of the rising tide of fanaticism that has swept the Middle East and has also, unfortunately, infected Palestinian society.  So I want this to change. I want those two prerequisites of peace—substance, not labels—I want them reinstated. But if anyone believes that I, as Prime Minister of Israel, responsible for the security of my country, would blindly walk into a Palestinian terrorist state that seeks the destruction of my country, they're gravely mistaken.  The two prerequisites of peace—recognition of the Jewish state, and Israel's security needs west of the Jordan—they remain pertinent. We have to look for new ways, new ideas on how to reinstate them and how to move peace forward. And I believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach from involving our newfound Arab partners in their pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the Palestinians.  And I greatly look forward to discussing this in detail with you, Mr. President, because I think that if we work together, we have a shot.  President Trump. And we have been discussing that, and it is something that is very different, hasn't been discussed before. And it's actually a much bigger deal, a much more important deal, in a sense. It would take in many, many countries, and it would cover a very large territory. So I didn't know you were going to be mentioning that, but that's—now that you did, I think it's a terrific thing, and I think we have some pretty good cooperation from people that in the past would never, ever have even thought about doing this. So we'll see how that works out.  Katie from Townhall [Katie Pavlich, Townhall.com]. Where's Katie? Right there. Katie.  Arab-Israeli Peace Process Q. Thank you, Mr. President. You said in your earlier remarks that both sides will have to make compromises when it comes to a peace deal. You've mentioned a halt on settlements. Can you lay out a few more specific compromises that you have in mind, both for the Israelis and for the Palestinians?  And, Mr. Prime Minister, what expectations do you have from the new administration about how to either amend the Iran nuclear agreement or how to dismantle it altogether, and how to overall work with the new administration to combat Iran's increased aggression, not only in the last couple of months, but the past couple of years as well?  President Trump. It's actually an interesting question. I think that the Israelis are going to have to show some flexibility, which is hard; it's hard to do. They're going to have to show the fact that they really want to make a deal. I think our new concept that we've been discussing actually for a while is something that allows them to show more flexibility than they have in the past because you have a lot bigger canvas to play with. And I think they'll do that.  I think they very much would like to make a deal, or I wouldn't be happy, and I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be as optimistic as I am. I really think they—I can tell you from the standpoint of Bibi and from the standpoint of Israel, I really believe they want to make a deal and they'd like to see the big deal.  I think the Palestinians have to get rid of some of that hate that they're taught from a very young age. They're taught tremendous hate. I've seen what they're taught. And you can talk about flexibility there too, but it starts at a very young age, and it starts in the school room. And they have to acknowledge Israel; they're going to have to do that. There's no way a deal can be made if they're not ready to acknowledge a very, very great and important country. And I think they're going to be willing to do that also. But now I also believe we're going to have, Katie, other players at a very high level, and I think it might make it easier on both the Palestinians and Israel to get something done.  Okay? Thank you. Very interesting question. Thank you.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. You asked about Iran. One thing is preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons, something that President Trump and I think are deeply committed to do. And we are obviously going to discuss that.  I think, beyond that, President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the Presidency. He pointed out there are violations, Iranian violations, on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed."" The Palestinian—rather the Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said, well, our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country. No. They write on the missile in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed.""  So challenging Iran on its violations of ballistic missiles, imposing sanctions on Hizballah, preventing them, making them pay for the terrorism that they foment throughout the Middle East and beyond, well beyond, I think that's a change that is clearly evident. And since President Trump took office, I welcome that. I think it's—let me say this very openly: I think it's long overdue.  And I think that if we work together—and not just the United States and Israel, but so many others in the region who see eye to eye on the great magnitude and danger of the Iranian threat—then I think we can roll back Iran's aggression and danger. And that's something that is important for Israel, the Arab States, but I think it's vitally important for America. These guys are developing ICBMs. They're developing—they want to get to a nuclear arsenal, not a bomb, a hundred bombs. And they want to have the ability to launch them everywhere on Earth, and including—and especially, eventually—the United States.  So this is something that is important for all of us. I welcome the change, and I intend to work with President Trump very closely so that we can thwart this danger.  President Trump. Great. Do you have somebody?  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Moav [Moav Vardi, Israel's Channel 10]?  2016 Presidential Election/Anti-Semitism  Q. Mr. President, since your election campaign and even after your victory, we've seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States. And I wonder what you say to those among the Jewish community in the States and in Israel and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones.  And, Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree to what the President just said about the need for Israel to restrain or to stop settlement activity in the West Bank? And a quick follow-up on my friend's questions—simple question: Do you back off from your vision to the end of the conflict of two-state solution as you laid out in Bar-Ilan speech, or you still support it? Thank you.  President Trump. Well, I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had—306 electoral college votes. We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right? There was no way to 221, but then they said there's no way to 270. And there's tremendous enthusiasm out there.  I will say that we are going to have peace in this country. We are going to stop crime in this country. We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing that's going on, because lot of bad things have been taking place over a long period of time.  I think one of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation. Very divided. And hopefully, I'll be able to do something about that. And I—you know, it was something that was very important to me.  As far as people—Jewish people—so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren. I think that you're going to see a lot different United States of America over the next 3, 4, or 8 years. I think a lot of good things are happening, and you're going to see a lot of love. You're going to see a lot of love. Okay? Thank you.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. I believe that the issue of the settlements is not the core of the conflict, nor does it really drive the conflict. I think it's an issue; it has to be resolved in the context of peace negotiations. And I think it also—we also are going to speak about it, President Trump and I, so we can arrive at an understanding so we don't keep on bumping into each other all the time on this issue. And we're going to discuss this.  On the question you said, you just came back with your question to the problem that I said. It's the label. What does Abu Mazen mean by two states, okay? What does he mean? A state that doesn't recognize the Jewish state? A state that basically is open for attack against Israel? What are we talking about? Are we talking about Costa Rica, or are we talking about another Iran?  So obviously, it means different things. I told you what are the conditions that I believe are necessary for an agreement: It's the recognition of the Jewish state, and it's Israel's—Israel's—security control of the entire area. Otherwise, we're just fantasizing. Otherwise, we'll get another failed state, another terrorist, Islamist dictatorship that will not work for peace, but work to destroy us but also destroy any hope—any hope—for a peaceful future for our people.  So I've been very clear about those conditions, and they haven't changed. I haven't changed. If you read what I said 8 years ago, it's exactly that. And I repeated that again, and again, and again. If you want to deal with labels, deal with labels. I'll deal with substance.  And finally, one—if I can respond to something that I know from personal experience. I've known President Trump for many years, and to allude to him, or to his people, his team, some of whom I've known for many years too. Can I reveal, Jared, how long we've known you? [Laughter] Well, he was never small. He was always big. [Laughter] He was always tall.  But I've known the President and I've known his family and his team for a long time, and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump. I think we should put that to rest.  President Trump. Thank you very much. Very nice. I appreciate that very much.  Prime Minister Netanyahu. Thank you.",NA
